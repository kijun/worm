She centers her attention on those factors that are universal to all life, things that will move her closer to others. Then her comparisons, if any, lead to feelings of kinship rather than of estrangement",,452

5/31/2023,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,John Gardner,"The writer, in other words, has done the first job done in all serious fiction—he has created a convincing and illuminating sequence of events—but he has not done the second, which is to mine deeper! as Melville says, dig out the fundamental meaning of events by organizing the imitation of reality around some primary question or theme suggested by the characters concern",,372

5/31/2023,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,John Gardner,"Good description is symbolic not because the writer plants symbols in it but because, by working in the proper way, he forces symbols still largely mysterious to him up into his conscious mind where, little by little as his fiction progresses, he can work with them and finally understand them.

5/31/2023,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,John Gardner,"The point of these technical exercises is this: Most apprentice writers underestimate the difficulty of becoming artists; they do not understand or believe that great writers are usually those who, like concert pianists, know many ways of doing everything they do. Knowledge is no substitute for genius; but genius supported by vast technique makes a literary master. Especially just now, when competition for publication is probably greater than ever before, it is helpful for a writer to know technique",,504
5/31/2023,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,John Gardner,"This brief, rough sketch of a possible story raises an extremely important point—a point as fundamental, for the most serious kind of writer, as the concept of the uninterruptible fictional dream. What we have so far, in the sketch weve worked out—and what many quite good writers never go beyond—is a projected piece of fiction that, if well-written, will be no more than a persuasive imitation of reality. It shows how things happen and may imply certain values, but it does not look hard at the meaning of things. It has no real theme. This is a common limitation of second-rate fiction and may sometimes characterize even quite powerful fiction, like Eudora Weltys novel Losing Battles",,689
5/31/2023,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,John Gardner,"From all we have said about plotting in general it should be evident that even in those modern plots in which events happen by laws not immediately visible—as when, for instance, the tattooed man in the circus reveals in the course of a whimsical conversation that he has on his chest a tattoo of the little girl now looking at him, a child he has never before seen, or as when, in Isak Dinesen, a decorous old nun turns abruptly into a monkey—there must be some rational or poetically persuasive basis. We can enjoy a story that has some secret logic we sense but cannot immediately guess; but if we begin to suspect that the basis of profluence is nothing but mad whimsey, we begin to be distracted from the fictional dream by our questions, doubts, and puzzlement, our feeling that the story is getting nowhere. The mad story—surrealist, expressionist, or whatever—must be as carefully plotted as the story with causally related actions",,939
5/31/2023,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,John Gardner,"True artists, whatever smiling faces they may show you, are obsessive, driven people—whether driven by some mania or driven by some high, noble vision need not presently concern us. Anyone who has worked both as artist and as professor can tell you, I think, that he works very differently in his two styles. No one is more careful, more scrupulously honest, more devoted to his personal vision of the ideal, than a good professor trying to write a book about the Gilgamesh. He may write far into the night, he may avoid parties, he may feel pangs of guilt about having spent too little time with his family. Nevertheless, his work is no more like an artists work than the work of a first-class accountant is like that of an athlete contending for a championship. He uses faculties of the mind more easily available to us; he has, on all sides of him, stays, checks, safeties, rules of procedure that guide and secure him. Hes a man sure of where he stands in the world. He belongs on sunlit walkways, in ivied halls. With the artist, not so. No critical study, however brilliant, is the fierce psychological battle a novel is. The qualities that make a true artist—nearly the same qualities that make a true athlete—make it important that the student writer never be prevented from working as seriously as he knows how to. In university courses we do exercises. Term papers, quizzes, final examinations are not meant for publication. We move through a course on Dostoevsky or Poe as we move through a mildly good cocktail party, picking up the good bits of food or conversation, bearing with the rest, going home when it comes to seem the reasonable thing to do. Art, at those moments when it feels most like art—when we feel most alive, most alert, most triumphant—is less like a cocktail party than a tank full of sharks. Everythings for keeps, nothings just for exercise",,1874

What youre saying now is so—so damned antiquarian!",,223
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"Everyone must at some time take the step that separates him from his father, from his teachers; everyone must taste a little of the toughness of solitude, even though most people cant stand much of it and soon knuckle under again.—I",,232
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"I lost a lot by doing violence to my dreams of love when I was your age. No one should do that. If a person knows about Abraxas, he must no longer do that. He should be afraid of nothing and consider nothing taboo that the soul within us desires",,245
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"for each of us to become so completely himself, so completely in harmony with the creative germ of Nature within himself, living in accordance with its commands, that the uncertain future would find us ready for any eventuality, whatever it might bring",,252
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"Its always difficult to be born. As you know, the bird must make an effort to break out of the egg. Think back and ask: Was the path really that difficult? Merely difficult? Wasnt it also beautiful? Could you have thought of a more beautiful or easier one?",,256
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"Yes, there was a false note in this, and it all tasted cheaper and more common than love ought to taste in my opinion—but anyway, it was reality, it was life and adventure; someone was sitting next to me who had experienced it, to whom it seemed self evident",,258
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"Now I saw delightedly that all of that had merely been covered over and thrown in the shade, and that it was possible, even for a liberated person giving up childish joys, to see the world in its radiance and to taste the intimate thrills of a childs viewpoint",,260
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"Those primal feelings, even the wildest of them, werent directed against the enemy; their bloody results were merely an outward materialization of peoples inner life, the split within their souls, which desired to rage and kill, destroy and die, so that they could be reborn",,274
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"I took no vow—I had arrived at a goal, at an elevated stopping place on my journey, from which the continuation of the path was revealed in its length and splendor, striving toward promised lands, shaded by treetops of nearby happiness, cooled by the nearby gardens of all sorts of pleasure",,290
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"I, too, was hugged by people I had never seen, and I understood and gladly reciprocated. It was an intoxication in which they acted that way, they werent in harmony with their fate; but the intoxication was holy, it was caused by their all having taken that brief, rousing look into the eyes of destiny",,302
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"One guide has left me. Im completely in the dark. I cant take a step by myself. Help me! I wanted to send it to Demian. But I didnt; every time I wanted to, it looked silly and pointless. But I knew that brief prayer by heart and often recited it to myself. It accompanied me at all times. I began to sense the meaning of prayer",,328
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"Once he was standing by the sea again at night, on the high cliff, looking up at the star and blazing with love for it. And in a moment of supreme longing he jumped and plunged into the void, in the direction of the star. But at the moment he jumped he still thought, quick as a flash: But its impossible! There he lay, down on the beach, shattered",,348
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"People like you and me are really lonely, its true, but we still have one another, we have the secret satisfaction of being different, of rebelling, of desiring the unusual. That, too, must fall by the wayside if a person wants to follow the path to its end. He mustnt even desire to be a revolutionary, a role model, or a martyr. Its beyond imagining—",,352
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"I had grown accustomed to live inwardly, and I was resigned to the belief that I had simply lost all feeling for the world outside; to the belief that the loss of those glowing colors was inevitably linked to the loss of childhood, and that to some extent the freedom and adulthood of the soul had to be paid for with the renunciation of that lovely shining",,357
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"If, for example, a moth of that type wanted to focus its willpower on a star or some such thing, it wouldnt be able to. But it never tries to. Its only out after things that have meaning and value for it, things it needs and absolutely must have. And then it even accomplishes the unbelievable—it develops a magical sixth sense that no other animal possesses!",,359
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"But, if thats the case, you must also know that you have never fully lived out your thoughts, and that isnt good. Only the thoughts that we live out have any value. You knew that your permissible world was only half the world, and you tried to hide away the second half from yourself, the way clergymen and teachers do. You wont succeed! No one can do that when he has once begun to think",,388
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"Fine, I objected, but what then comprises the worth of the individual? Why do we still strive for things when everything is already there within us? Stop right there! Pistorius shouted. Theres a big difference between merely carrying the world inside you and knowing that you do! A madman can produce ideas that resemble Platos, and a pious little schoolboy in a Herrnhut institute7 can creatively reconstruct profound mythological associations in his mind, ideas to be found in the Gnostics or Zoroaster. But he doesnt know hes doing it! Hes a tree or a stone, at best an animal, just as long as he doesnt know that. But when the first spark of that knowledge",,660
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"In the clouds I could see a great city from which poured millions of people, who spread out in swarms over wide stretches of countryside. Into their midst there stepped a powerful divine figure, sparkling stars in its hair, tall as a mountain chain, with the features of Lady Eve. Into that figure, as if into a gigantic cave, the columns of people vanished, and were lost from view. The goddess crouched down on the ground, the mark on her forehead gleaming brightly. A dream seemed to overpower her, she shut her eyes, and her huge face was distorted with pain. Suddenly she screamed shrilly, and from her forehead shot stars, many thousands of radiant stars, which flung themselves across the black sky in splendid arcs and semicircles",,738
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"Our religion is practiced as if it werent one. It behaves as if it were entirely rational. In a pinch I could be a Catholic, but a Protestant clergyman—no! The handful of true believers—I know some—abide by the literal meaning; I couldnt tell them, for example, that for me Christ is not an individual, but a hero, a myth, an enormous shadow in which mankind sees its own image cast onto the wall of eternity. And the rest, those who come to church to hear a wise saying, to fulfill a duty, to avoid being negligent, and so on, what was I supposed to tell them? Was I to convert them, you think? But I dont want to. A priest isnt out for conversions, he wants to live only among believers, people like himself; he wants to be the bearer and the spokesman of the emotion out of which we create our gods",,801
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"glimmers, he becomes a human being. You certainly dont consider all the bipeds running around the street to be human beings merely because they walk upright and carry their young for nine months? After all, you see how many of them are fish or sheep, worms or leeches, how many are ants, how many are bees! Now, each one of them has the potentiality of becoming a human being, but only when he senses that potential, when he even learns to be conscious of it to some degree, does that potential belong to him. Our conversations were more or less of that type. They seldom offered me anything completely new or totally surprising. But all of them, even the most banal, hit the same spot in me with a steady, gentle hammer blow; they all helped form my character, they all helped to strip dead skins off me, to crush eggshells; and after each one I raised my head a little higher, a little more freely, until my yellow bird pushed its beautiful predators head out of the shattered globe",,984
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"All right. But you yourself mustnt be a moralist, either! You shouldnt compare yourself with others; and if nature has made you a bat, you shouldnt try to turn yourself into an ostrich. You sometimes think youre peculiar, you reproach yourself for going other ways than most people. Youve got to get that out of your head. Look into the fire, look into the clouds, and as soon as your presentiments come and the voices in your soul begin to speak, surrender yourself to them and dont start off by asking whether that suits or pleases your teacher, your father, or some God or other! If you do that, youll ruin yourself. That way you get on the sidewalk and you become a fossil. My friend Sinclair, our god is named Abraxas; he is God and Satan; both the bright world and the dark world are contained in him. Abraxas has no objections to any of your thoughts or any of your dreams. Never forget that. But hell abandon you if you ever become faultless and normal. Then hell abandon you and look for a new pot to cook his ideas in",,1027
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"But another time she told me another tale. It was about a man who loved without hope. He withdrew completely inside himself, and thought he would burn up with love. He lost contact with the world; he no longer saw the blue sky and the green forest; the brook didnt murmur for him, the harp didnt sound for him; everything had gone under, and he had become poor and miserable. But his love grew, and he was much readier to die and wither away than to renounce the possession of the beautiful woman he loved. Then he noticed that his love had burnt up everything else in him; it became powerful and exerted more and more attraction; and the beautiful woman was compelled to follow; she came, he stood there with outstretched arms to draw her to himself. But when she stood before him, she was totally transformed, and with trembling he felt and saw that he had attracted to himself the entire world he had lost. It stood before him and yielded itself to him; sky and forest and brook, everything came to meet him in new colors, vivid and splendid; it belonged to him, it spoke his language. And instead of merely winning a woman, he had the whole world on his bosom, and every star in the sky shone within him and sparkled joy into his soul.—He had loved and, by doing so, had found himself. But most people love in order to lose themselves",,1338
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"And at that point the realization suddenly burned me like a searing flame: For each person there was an office, but for nobody was there one that he was permitted to choose for himself, to define, and to fill according to his own wishes. It was wrong to desire new gods, it was totally wrong to try and give the world anything! There was no duty for enlightened people, none, none, except this: to seek themselves, to become certain of themselves, to grope forward along their own path, wherever it might lead.—I was deeply affected by that, and for me that was the profit from that experience. I had often played with images of the future, I had dreamt of roles that might be meant for me, as a poet, perhaps, or as a prophet, or as a painter, or whatever else. That was all meaningless. I didnt exist to write poetry, to preach sermons, to paint pictures; neither I nor anyone else existed for that purpose. All of that merely happened to a person along the way. Everyone had only one true vocation: to find himself. Let him wind up as a poet or a madman, as a prophet or a criminal—that wasnt his business; in the long run, it was irrelevant. His business was to discover his own destiny, not just any destiny, and to live it totally and undividedly. Anything else was just a half-measure, an attempt to run away, an escape back to the ideal of the masses, an adaptation, fear of ones own nature. Fearsome and sacred, the new image rose up before me; I had sensed it a hundred times, perhaps I had already enunciated it, but now I was experiencing it for the first time. I was a gamble of Nature, a throw of the dice into an uncertain realm, leading perhaps to something new, perhaps to nothing; and to let this throw from the primordial depths take effect, to feel its will inside myself and adopt it completely as my own will: that alone was my vocation. That alone!",,1871
5/26/2023,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),Hermann Hesse,"Community, Demian said, is a fine thing. But the type we see blossoming all over isnt true community. It will originate anew, out of the knowledge that individuals have of one another, and for a while it will transform the world. The kind of community we have now is merely herd instinct. People run to one another for shelter because theyre afraid of one another—capitalists stick together, workers stick together, scholars stick together! And why are they afraid? A person is afraid only when he isnt at one with himself. Theyre afraid because they have never accepted themselves. A community consisting exclusively of people afraid of the unknown in themselves! They all feel that the rules they live by are no longer valid, that theyre following outdated commandments; neither their religions nor their morality, nothing is suited to what we need. For a century and more, Europe has done nothing but study and build factories! They know exactly how many grams of powder it takes to kill someone, but they dont know how to pray to God, they dont even know how to be contented for an hour at a time. Just take a look at a students tavern like these! Or even a pleasure resort that rich people go to! Hopeless!—My dear Sinclair, no serenity can come from any of that. These people who rub elbows so anxiously are filled with fear and filled with malice, none of them trusts anyone else. They cling to ideals that no longer count, and they cast stones at everyone who proclaims a new one. I foresee confrontations. Theyll come, believe me, theyll come soon! Naturally, they wont improve the world. Whether the workers kill the factory owners or Russia and Germany shoot at each other, that will only mean a change of ownership. But it wont all be for nothing. It will show clearly just how worthless todays ideals are; there will be a clearing out of Stone Age gods. This world, as it now is, wants to die, it wants to perish, and it will",,1938

5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"Without ever forsaking the fundamental plan of his studies, which as we have seen he outlined in his letter to Fritz Tegularius, he pushed forward energetically on a broad front wherever he scented an element of essential value to himself, that is to say, wherever the path of awakening, on which he had already set out, seemed to lead him",,339
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"The Game as I conceive it, Knecht once wrote to the former Music Master, encompasses the player after the completion of meditation as the surface of a sphere encompasses its center, and leaves him with the feeling that he has extracted from the universe of accident and confusion a totally symmetrical and harmonious cosmos, and absorbed it into himself",,353
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"Ultimately he wondered whether he had become a follower of Veraguth out of a sense of truth and justice or whether he had not been at least half seduced by the mans gifts as a speaker and rabble-rouser, his charm and nimble wit in public appearances, the sonority of his voice, his splendid virile laughter, and the intelligence and beauty of his daughter",,355
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"The ideal world, which hitherto his young soul had known only by hearsay and in wild dreams, had suddenly taken on visible lineaments for him. Its gates had opened invitingly. This world, he now saw, did not exist only in some vague, remote past or future; it was here and was active; it glowed, sent messengers, apostles, ambassadors, men like this old Magister",,362
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"In former days, and in fact only yesterday, had he not considered his own special kind of perception—that way of experiencing reality which he called awakening—as a slow, step-by-step penetration into the heart of the universe, into the core of truth; as something in itself absolute, a continuous path or progression which nevertheless had to be achieved gradually?",,366
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"He had failed in his efforts to become a mediator between the world and Castalia; he had not contrived to create a synthesis of the worldly and Castalian components in his background and character, and had instead turned into an isolated and embittered outsider. Nevertheless, he was not simply a failure. In defeat and renunciation he had in spite of everything shaped a selfhood",,380
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"But I more and more see that for me to remain among you would mean escaping. It would be a fine, a noble escape perhaps, but still an escape. I shall return and become a man of the outside world, but one who continues grateful to your Castalia, who will go on practicing a good many of your exercises, and will come every year to join in the celebration of the great Glass Bead Game",,382
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"Whenever I try to fathom how my friend Knecht managed to do anything with a person as confirmedly unhappy as myself, I see more and more plainly that his power was based on magic and, I must add, on a streak of roguishness. He was an arch-rogue, far more than his own underlings realized, full of playfulness, wit, slyness, delighting in magicians tricks, in guises, in surprising disappearances and appearances",,411
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"Awakening, it seemed, was not so much concerned with truth and cognition, but with experiencing and proving oneself in the real world. When you had such an awakening, you did not penetrate any closer to the core of things, to truth; you grasped, accomplished, or endured only the attitude of your own ego to the momentary situation. You did not find laws, but came to decisions; you did not thrust your way into the center of the world, but into the center of your own individuality",,482
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"More and more he had to bid farewell to the dream, the feeling and the pleasure of infinite potentialities, of a multiplicity of futures. Instead of the dream of unending progress, of the sum of all wisdom, his pupil stood by, a small, near, demanding reality, an intruder and nuisance, but no longer to be rebuffed or evaded. For the boy represented, after all, the only way into the real future, the one most important duty, the one narrow path along which the Rainmakers life and acts, principles, thoughts, and glimmerings could be saved from death and continue their life in a small new bud. Sighing, gnashing his teeth, and smiling, he accepted the burden",,661
5/19/2023,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,Hermann Hesse and Theodore Ziolkowski and Richard Winston and and Clara Winston,"Worldly people are children, my son. And saints—well, they do not come to confess to us. But you and I and our kind, we ascetics and seekers and eremites—we are not children and are not innocent and cannot be set straight by moralizing sermons. We are the real sinners, we who know and think, who have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, and we should not treat one another like children who are given a few blows of the rod and left to go their way again. After a confession and penance we do not run away back to the world where children celebrate feasts and do business and now and then kill one another. We do not experience sin like a brief bad dream which can be thrown off by confession and sacrifice; we dwell in it. We are never innocent; we are always sinners; we dwell in sin and in the fire of conscience, and we know that we can never pay our great debt unless after our departure God looks mercifully upon us and receives us into His grace. That, Joseph, is the reason I cannot deliver sermons and dictate penances to you and me. We are not involved in one or another misstep or crime, but always and forever in original sin itself. This is why each of us can only assure the other that he shares his knowledge and feels brotherly love; neither of us can cure the other by penances. Surely you must have known this?",,1325

There was no lessening of internal conflict, but only a marked non-defensiveness in experiencing such conflicts3 among their subjects. The implications of these findings are profound, because Brown and Engler discovered that meditation, on its own, is not particularly effective at solving peoples emotional problems. It can prepare the ground, so to speak, by making the person more accepting and less defensive, but without a therapists intervention, there is a very real danger of paralysis. We are faced here with our first conundrum: Meditation, it seems, can bestow the kind of ego strength necessary for a successful psychotherapy, but it cannot do the psychotherapy by itself",,793

There is rarely desire without some associated anxiety: We seem to be wired to have apprehension about that which we cannot control, so in this way, the two are not really complete opposites. But desire gives one a reason to tolerate anxiety and a willingness to push through it",,403
5/2/2023,Open to Desire: The Truth About What the Buddha Taught,Mark Epstein,"In the early Buddhist traditions, desire was viewed as a poison to be avoided. The later Mahayana view was not to avoid the poison, but to antidote it with the appropriate remedy. In Tantra, desire is seen as a potent energy to be used on the path to enlightenment; just as peacocks in the jungle thrive on poisonous plants and transform them symbolically into the radiant plumage of their tail feathers.6",,405

Somehow the word must have gotten out, because before dawn I was awakened by clouds of dust rising from the feet of the crowds descending on his tent. This event was no abstract cultivation of generosity or loving kindness, nor was it an offering of teachings on wisdom: It was alms-giving on a mammoth scale. The bodhisattva of compassion, of whom the Dalai Lama was reputed to be an incarnation, was literally giving away rupees, and the response from the local population was overwhelming",,595
5/2/2023,Open to Desire: The Truth About What the Buddha Taught,Mark Epstein,"All that attention comes with a lot of expectations, I began. Western parents dont feel that their children already are who they are—they feel that it is their job to make them who they should be. They treat their children more as objects than as individuals who already are themselves. Children feel this as a burden. A pressure, the lama replied. A pressure.

More than our parents/children/teachers think we are. We fear that we actually possess the talent that our still, small voice tells us. That we actually have the guts, the perseverance, the capacity. We fear that we truly can steer our ship, plant our flag, reach our Promised Land. We fear this because, if its true, then we become estranged from all we know. We pass through a membrane.

We might do it only so as not to let down our co-workers, or for other, less noble reasons. But we do it. We show up no matter what.   3) We stay on the job all day. Our minds may wander, but our bodies remain at the wheel. We pick up the phone when it rings, we assist the customer when he seeks our help. We dont go home till the whistle blows.   4) We are committed over the long haul. Next year we may go to another job, another company, another country. But well still be working. Until we hit the lottery, we are part of the labor force.   5) The stakes for us are high and real. This is about survival, feeding our families, educating our children. Its about eating.   6) We accept remuneration for our labor. Were not here for fun. We work for money.   7) We do not overidentify with our jobs.

4/12/2023,The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho,"All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses.

4/12/2023,The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho,"When I have been truly searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because Ive known that every hour was a part of the dream that I would find it.

4/12/2023,The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho,"A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to pray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didnt give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures; it didnt ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal; and it didnt beseech that the woman he had met continue to await his return",,364
4/12/2023,The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho,"The boys heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Soul of the World, stories of men who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found love and riches",,378
4/12/2023,The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho,"Im already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place, while my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better than they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see that it hasnt been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always wanted it to be. I dont want to change anything, because I dont know how to deal with change. Im used to the way I am",,440
4/12/2023,The Alchemist,Paulo Coelho,"Because its not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to roam the world like the wind. And its not love to see everything from a distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I thought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we live in will be either better or worse, depending on whether we become better or worse. And thats where the power of love comes in",,608

Then I realized that the objects of my awareness began to have texture. By texture I mean depth. This texture is deceptive because it first arises from the memory or imagination. Soon the texture reveals clarity. This is a movement to present awareness without the distorting effects of memory or imagination. My mind settled and I gave up all struggle. I live this way now as much as I can. I dont know if this is what is supposed to happen. But its what happens with me. I became still. I learned to listen, to care",,614

Practicing mindfulness, she began to be able to feel her body and focus on its sensations. She could feel her tension, but she could also hear the screech of a scrub jay outside the window and see the slant of the morning light. Coming into her senses, she could see her worry and panic as the product of fearful, imagined stories, not as present truths. Margo also learned mindful walking to feel her steps, to touch the earth in the here and now. Through Brians treatment and hospital visits, his long struggle with cancer, Margo worked diligently with mindfulness to stay in the present. She said it was her only relief",,691
4/3/2023,The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology,Jack Kornfield,"As children, many of us were taught courage in the form of the warrior or the explorer, bravely facing danger. In the Buddhist understanding, however, great courage is not demonstrated by aggression or ambition. Aggression and ambition are more often expressions of fear and delusion. The courageous heart is the one that is unafraid to open to the world. With compassion we come to trust our capacity to open to life without armoring. As the poet Rilke reminds us, Ultimately it is on our vulnerability that we depend. This is not a poetic ideal but a living reality, demonstrated by our most beloved sages. Mahatma Gandhi had the courage to be jailed and beaten, to persevere through difficulties without giving in to bitterness and despair. His vulnerability became his strength",,781
4/3/2023,The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology,Jack Kornfield,"This is how Cynthia later described it. I was gradually able to see that my hungry ghost tendency did not make me a failure as a human being. Because the self-hatred was so intense, I could only say, May this suffering body be healed, may this sad heart be free. And recently, amazingly, when I am able to see the tendency to start on that sad old path, grasping for the illusory magic of food, a compassionate awareness will arise and say, Oh, I dont really want this. It will only lead to pain and sadness. These moments are a miracle really, a release from the agony of the hungry ghost. It is as if, like the temptations of Buddha on his enlightenment night, I can feel the pain, see the grasping, and finally say, I see you, Mara and let it go. This struggle has opened my heart to the suffering of others. Hungry ghosts are around us all the time. Because of my experience I see them in so many people. Its not just food, but any kind of grasping. I feel such compassion because I know how much it hurts. Only by letting go will they heal, will they free their hearts",,1073
4/3/2023,The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology,Jack Kornfield,"psychology describes the state of addiction as becoming a hungry ghost. No matter how much the ghost tries to eat, satisfaction is impossible. This is the state of consciousness where desire becomes insatiable, thirst becomes unquenchable. For the hungry ghost, like an addict, a few moments of relief come with the drink or the high or the binge, followed by a pause and craving for more. The suffering of desire is apparent in addiction, but ordinary desire has its suffering too. We want to be thinner, more charming, admired, successful, secure. We use our desires to distract ourselves from discomfort. When an unconscious feeling of insecurity, boredom, or emptiness arises, desire follows. We open the refrigerator, turn on the TV, lose ourselves in distraction or busyness or addiction. We want another piece of chocolate cake to inspire us, a drink or a tidbit of gossip to make us feel better. Desires act like temporary painkillers—while they are harmless at first, we can become habituated. The more lonely and separate we feel, the more we turn to desires to compensate. We go through our day yanked by the chain of one desire after another until we finally lose touch with who we really are. Though the world may reward us for our drivenness, internally we are diminished. Virginia Woolf describes it this way: If people are highly successful in their professions they lose their senses…. Sight goes. They have no time to look at pictures. Sound goes. They have no time to listen to music. Speech goes. They have no time for conversation. They lose their sense of proportion…. Humanity goes. In modern life, compulsive desire is visible on a global scale: in the greed for oil, the clearing of rain forests, the privatization of rivers and lakes, and the patenting of such human staples as beans and corn. The world, said Ajahn Chah, is in a feverish state. Buddhist activist Helena Norberg-Hodge describes how modern desire has affected the Tibetan communities in Ladakh, India. For a thousand years, they believed they were blessed. They lived simply, with rainfall enough to grow their crops and time to tend their temples and follow the sacred rhythm of their year. When Ladakh first opened to the West in the 1970s, the Ladakhis told their visitors how abundant and rich they felt their lives were. Now, thirty years later, after exposure to television and wristwatches…",,2389

He who, being thus equipped, is without desire for the result and is yet wholly engrossed in the due fulfillment of the task before him, is said to have renounced the fruits of his action",,395

3/19/2023,Be Here Now (Enhanced Edition),Ram Dass,"In order to perform karma yoga, there is a simple general principle to keep in mind: bring a third component into every action. If, for example, you are digging a ditch, there is you who is digging the ditch, and the ditch which is being dug. Now add a third focus: say, a disinterested person who is seeing you dig the ditch. Now run the entire action through his head while you are digging. Its as simple as that",,414
3/19/2023,Be Here Now (Enhanced Edition),Ram Dass,"As they say in the Sikh religion—Once you realize God knows everything, youre free.

And yet, I never felt so profound an intimacy with another being. It was as if he were inside of my heart. And what started to blow my mind was that everywhere we went, he was at home",,482
3/19/2023,Be Here Now (Enhanced Edition),Ram Dass,"The first is to avoid the fulfilling of the still-active desires, using the energy instead for specific acts of purification. The second alternative is to use the energy to fulfill the desire once again, but simultaneously to be conscious of the entire process, that is, use the experience to get finished with the desire. This second method, called ban marg, or the left-handed path, is very risky. Most people who attempt to use it are not successful and succeed only in creating more karma. However, it is such a seductive route that most Westerners prefer it and wrap their subsequent failure in layers of rationalization. What is required",,643
3/19/2023,Be Here Now (Enhanced Edition),Ram Dass,"On the surface, this method looks like what psychologists call the defense mechanism of dissociation. A girl goes to a dance and no one asks her to dance . . . and she adopts a superior separateness . . . watching it all with the thought: I couldnt be less interested in dancing. This response of separating herself from her desire arises because she so badly wants to dance. It must be differentiated from the adoption of a witness when you have finished with dancing, so to speak. The witness we are considering here is hardly an unconscious defense mechanism. Though they look alike on the surface, they are quite different. But only you know which is which",,660
3/19/2023,Be Here Now (Enhanced Edition),Ram Dass,"The difficulty with adding just any third party is that you might attribute to that other person certain motives or values. In order to avoid that, it is useful to pick the third focal point with an eye towards your goal of enlightenment. That is, pick someone who is already enlightened, such as Krishna or Ram or a Buddha or Christ. They see it all. They are beyond it all. They understand how it all is. As they watch you digging the ditch, they see the act in all its cosmic significance . . . its the first and last digging of a ditch. They understand why you are doing it and all the thoughts in your head, all your history, and they even understand the future—how it is when the ditch is all dug. And from this vantage point they have total compassion, total appreciation for all that is involved. To run the act of you digging a ditch through one of their heads allows you to get free of the ego-centric predicament, I am digging a ditch",,945

At times he thought he was on the verge of discovering a coherent, harmonious system underlying the infinite deformities and discords, but no model could stand up to the comparison with the game of chess. Perhaps, instead of racking ones brain to suggest with the ivory pieces scant help visions which were anyway destined to oblivion, it would suffice to play a game according to the rules, and to consider each successive state of the board as one of the countless forms that the system of forms assembles and destroys",,769

2/25/2023,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Michael A. Singer,"Stop and think about what youre capable of achieving.

2/25/2023,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Michael A. Singer,Plenty of events make it right through you. Why did you decide to resist this one? Something inside of you must have a basis for deciding when to simply let things pass through and when to assert willpower to either push them away or cling to them,,247
2/25/2023,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Michael A. Singer,"When a problem is disturbing you, dont ask, What should I do about it? Ask, What part of me is being disturbed by this?

2/25/2023,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Michael A. Singer,"In other words, if somebody does something that stimulates fear, you think they did something wrong.

2/25/2023,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Michael A. Singer,The alternative is to use life to let go of these impressions and the stress they create. In order to do this you have to become very conscious. You have to carefully watch the mental voice that tells you to resist something. It literally commands you: I dont like what he said. Fix it,,285
2/25/2023,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Michael A. Singer,"The power of Self, when it is concentrated and directed into the physical, mental, or emotional realms, creates a force, and we call that force will. Thats what you use when you try to make things happen or not happen. You are not helpless in there; you have the power to affect things",,285
2/25/2023,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Michael A. Singer,"When you resist, the energy has no place to go. It gets stuck in your psyche and seriously affects you. It blocks your hearts energy flow and causes you to feel closed and less vibrant. This is literally what is happening when something is weighing on your mind or when things just get too heavy for you",,303
2/25/2023,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Michael A. Singer,"If youre willing to be objective and watch all your thoughts, you will see that the vast majority of them have no relevance. They have no effect on anything or anybody, except you. They are simply making you feel better or worse about what is going on now, what has gone on in the past, or what might go on in the future",,320
2/25/2023,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Michael A. Singer,"Youre walking outside in the winter, you start to shiver, and the voice says, Its cold! Now how did that help you?

In order to stay safe, secure, and separate, we need to control not only ourselves but others, and the circumstances all around us. However, because the truth is that we do not have any control, we inevitably find ourselves in quite a bind",,434
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"What he was telling me, in essence, without really telling me directly, was that my ego, my preferences, played no part in the spiritual life, that he was not going to follow around my egos wants and desires, that our relationship was not going to be based in this. He drew a line in the sand. But as I let go of my ego a bit and started to listen to what he had to say, I then received an intuition and guidance from my inner teacher",,434
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"Its the same as being intimate with a view of a sunset, or the leaf on a tree, or the smile in a childs eyes. Its different emotional content, of course—it may be much more intimidating—but really what it means to be intimate with fear is the same as what it means to be intimate with anything else: Instead of running away from it, trying to solve it, making it into your problem, you can actually get very close to it. Getting close doesnt mean you",,450
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"And isnt it odd that even though life shows us over and over again that the ego doesnt have control, we keep believing that it does? We keep insisting that it does, because if it doesnt, that would be too overwhelming! It would seem like the worst thing that an ego could ever realize is that it doesnt have control, because if an ego doesnt have control, then it really has no hope. It has no way out. It has no way to make life into what it wants it to be",,457
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"But when you open yourself to this notion that all your ideas arent true, youre likely to feel quite empty-handed. The mind doesnt know quite what to do. It feels exposed and vulnerable. Its very likely that your mind has never been in this place before, and you might feel the minds compulsive desire to know. Thats okay, because its part of the function of the mind to try to know, to tell stories about the way things are. But the stories will never be as true as the way things really are",,492
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"One of the curious reasons why the ego always brings us back to suffering is that, strangely enough, our ego actually has to be in some resistance to what is. Otherwise, our sense of separation begins to dissolve, we move from our head into our heart and go from a place where we think we know into a very soft space in the heart. From the egoic point of view, its vital that we remain in conflict to some extent, and thats why, when we look at the world around us, we see so much conflict among human beings",,508
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"Since the time he lived, weve made Jesus into a projection of what we would hope an awake or God-realized being would be. And in doing so, weve sanitized him from what he seems to actually have been. When we read about the life of Jesus—what he did, how he acted, how he moved through the world of time and space—we see someone who doesnt conform to our conventional ideas of what it means to be awake. Yet, Jesus was an extremely dynamic personality, somebody with great vigor and a real fearlessness to allow spirit to manifest as it wished, which is really what true autonomy is",,581
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"If youve ever been with somebody whos close to physical death and who has also completely let go, you know what a state of freedom this can be. Its such an amazing, paradoxical moment, because there the person is, knowing theyre going to die, and yet they knew it all along. They knew it their whole life. They knew they were going to die, but they didnt really know it until they got some terminal disease, for example, or until the doctor said, Youve got six months to live. For others, the knowledge of death is a certainty: Im not going to make it out of here alive. With most people, however, whether theyve embraced the idea of death all along or not, theres a turn at the very seat of their consciousness when death looms",,728
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"When were truly able to know that whatever we think or say isnt the ultimate truth, then communicating becomes much more of a dance, a play, because we dont have to win or end up being right or correct in our communications. When we realize that what we think and say isnt ultimately the truth, then what we think and say can always adapt itself to the moment. This, in fact, is what wise action is: Activity, speech, and relationship that arises from wisdom and is in harmony with the moment. It is action that changes and molds itself to each and every moment. Each and every moment requires a different response than the last moment. Each conversation requires that you say something different than you did in the last communication",,735
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"I understand that our instinct is to move away from whats not comfortable, to try to get somewhere better, but as my teacher used to say, You need to take the backward step, not the forward step. The forward step is always moving ahead, always trying to attain what you want, whether its a material possession or inner peace. The forward step is very familiar: seeking and more seeking, striving and more striving, always looking for peace, always looking for happiness, looking for love. To take the backward step means to just turn around, reverse the whole process of looking for satisfaction on the outside, and look at precisely the place where you are standing. See if what you are looking for isnt already present in your experience",,739
2/23/2023,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Adyashanti,"Take the following thoughts, for example: imagine a sunny day on the beach, where youre lying in complete relaxation and you can hear the water lapping up against the shore. You can feel the warm sand supporting you from underneath. You can feel the rays of the sun across your face. You can hear the distant bird calls of seagulls. If you just think those thoughts, and allow yourself to really feel them, theyll start to change your consciousness. Youll literally start to feel different about this moment, even though nothing has actually changed, even though youre not actually at the beach. Even though all of it is created in your mind through imagination, it can change the way you feel, and how you feel affects how you perceive yourself, others, and the world around you",,779

1/31/2023,On Becoming a Novelist,John Gardner and Raymond Carver,"the love of good fiction that got him started in the first place makes him scornful of the flawed writing he does (nearly all first-draft writing is flawed), and his sense that nobody cares about truly good fiction robs him of motivation",,237
1/31/2023,On Becoming a Novelist,John Gardner and Raymond Carver,"In the writing state—the state of inspiration—the Active dream springs up fully alive: the writer forgets the words he has written on the page and sees, instead, his characters moving around their rooms, hunting through cupboards, glancing irritably through their mail, setting mousetraps, loading pistols",,305
1/31/2023,On Becoming a Novelist,John Gardner and Raymond Carver,"Such writers are probably wise to do it and get it over with, though theyd be wiser yet to improve their skills and publish somewhere better, for the futures sake.

1/31/2023,On Becoming a Novelist,John Gardner and Raymond Carver,"Some writers, Ive found, make the general assumption that every question asked in an auditorium or a writing class is essentially frivolous, presented in order to draw attention to the asker, or to flatter the visitor and keep things rolling, or simply from mad whim. I try to err in the opposite direction. I assume, in classrooms and auditoriums, as elsewhere, that human beings are smarter and nobler than misanthropic souls imagine. I doubt that anyone whose interest in novel-writing is fake will bother to read this book, and I assume that anyone who cares deeply about writing will forgive me if I say, on any given subject, more than seems necessary, since he will sympathize with my purpose, which is to be useful and thorough",,735
1/31/2023,On Becoming a Novelist,John Gardner and Raymond Carver,"I write for those who desire, not publication at any cost, but publication one can be proud of—serious, honest fiction, the kind of novel that readers will find they enjoy reading more than once, the kind of fiction likely to survive. Fine workmanship—art that avoids cheap and easy effects, takes no shortcuts, struggles never to lie even about the most trifling matters (such as which object, precisely, an angry man might pick up to throw at his kitchen wall, or whether a given character would in fact say you arent or the faintly more assertive youre not)—workmanship, in short, that impresses us partly by its painstaking care, gives pleasure and a sense of lifes worth and dignity not only to the reader but to the writer as well. This book is for the beginning novelist who has already figured out that it is far more satisfying to write well than simply to write well enough to get published",,900
1/31/2023,On Becoming a Novelist,John Gardner and Raymond Carver,"On the other hand, the writer who avoids writers workshops (or some other solid community of writers) is probably in for trouble. One can be fooled by the legend of, say, Jack London, and imagine that the best way to become a writer is to be a seaman or lumberjack. Jack London lived in an age when writers were folk heroes, as they are not now, and an age when technique was not quite as important as it is now. Though a tragic and noble man, he was a relatively bad writer. He could have used a few good teachers. Hemingway once remarked that the best way to become a writer is to go off and write. But his own way of doing it was to go to Paris, where many of the great writers were, and to study with the greatest theorist of the time, and one of the shrewdest writers, Gertrude Stein. Joseph Conrad, though we tend to think of him as a solitary genius, worked in close community with Ford Maddox Ford, H. G. Wells, Henry James, and Stephen Crane, among others. Melville had Hawthorne and his circle. Great writers are almost always associated with a literary dynasty. Its hard to find an exception. (Incredibly, even Malcolm Lowry was part of a group.) So for psychological reasons, if for no other, even a bad workshop may be better than none",,1248

The term holy (in common usage as well as in the work of many analysts often a synonym for sacred, which in turn, usually has wider and vaguer meaning than it does in this work) is distinguished here from sacred and will be reserved for the total religious phenomenon, the integration of its four elements which, I will argue, is achieved in ritual",,734

Rappaport,"I will argue that the performance of more or less invariant sequences of formal acts and utterances not entirely encoded by the performers logically entails the establishment of convention, the sealing of social contract, the construction of the integrated conventional orders we shall call Logoi (singular: Logos, see chapter 11), the investment of whatever it encodes with morality, the construction of time and eternity; the representation of a paradigm of creation, the generation of the concept of the sacred and the sanctification of conventional order, the generation of theories of the occult, the evocation of numinous experience, the awareness of the divine, the grasp of the holy, and the construction of orders of meaning transcending the semantic",,759
1/19/2023,Ritual and Religion in the Making of Humanity (Cambridge Studies in Social and Cultural Anthropology Book 110),Roy A. Rappaport,"Chapter 9 argued that the unquestionableness definitive of ultimate sacred postulates is a function of their expression in ritual, more specifically, a product of liturgical invariance. It had previously been argued (in chapter 4) that to perform an invariant order encoded by other than the performer constitutes an acceptance by the performer of that order. Although such acceptance does not necessarily signify belief in the contents of that order, nor guarantee actions conforming to it, it does establish an obligation to abide by it, and an agreement to have one's actions judged by it. In chapter 9 I further proposed that such acceptance is tantamount to agreement not to question that order or the Ultimate Sacred Postulate it expresses. Such agreements not to question constitute one ground of unquestionableness",,822

Now, in this winter of snow and crutches with Phineas, I began to know that each morning reasserted the problems of the night before, that sleep suspended all but changed nothing, that you couldnt make yourself over between dawn and dusk. Phineas however did not believe this. Im sure that he looked down at his leg every morning first thing, as soon as he remembered it, to see if it had not been totally restored while he slept",,679

12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,What Husserl noticed—that objects cant be exhausted by perception—has a viscous consequence. There is no Goldilocks position thats just right from which to view objects,,168

12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"Hyperobjects thus present philosophy with a difficult, double task.

12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"They involve profoundly different temporalities than the human-scale ones we are used to.

12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"Hyperobjects are agents.3 They are indeed more than a little demonic, in the sense that they appear to straddle worlds and times, like fiber optic cables or electromagnetic fields.

12/28/2022,Spacecraft (Object Lessons),Timothy Morton,"Scientism forgets that a scientific fact is an interpretation of data, and supposes that this fact points to a reality that is more real than others.

12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"Yet, for the same reasons, seeking out hypocrisy cannot be done from the point of view of cynicism. If there is no metalanguage, then cynical distance, the dominant ideological mode of the left, is in very bad shape, and will not be able to cope with the time of hyperobjects",,275
12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"Kant argues that aesthetic experience is an attunement (Stimmung).6 But I do not attune to My Bloody Valentine.

12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"Since for postmodernism everything is a metaphor in some strong sense, all metaphors are equally bad. But since for me, and indeed for all humans as we transition into the Age of Asymmetry there are real things for sure, just not as we know them or knew them, so some metaphors are better than others",,300
12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"This is because one only sees pieces of a hyperobject at any one moment. Thinking them is intrinsically tricky. This line of reasoning makes me seem like a postmodernist, though for reasons that will become clear, the emerging ecological age gets the idea that there is no metalanguage much more powerfully and nakedly than postmodernism ever did",,346
12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"Every attempt to pull myself free by some act of cognition renders me more hopelessly stuck to hyperobjects. Why? They are already here. I come across them later, I find myself poisoned with them, I find my hair falling out. Like an evil character in a David Lynch production, or a ghost in M. Knight Shyamalans The Sixth Sense, hyperobjects haunt my social and psychic space with an always-already",,398
12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"Now we know better: instead of the mythical land Away, we know the waste goes to the Pacific Ocean or the wastewater treatment facility. Knowledge of the hyperobject Earth, and of the hyperobject biosphere, presents us with viscous surfaces from which nothing can be forcibly peeled. There is no Away on this surface, no here and no there. In effect, the entire Earth is a wadded tissue of vomited milk",,402
12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"Hypocrisy results from the conditions of the impossibility of a metalanguage (and as I shall explain, we are now freshly aware of these conditions because of the ecological emergency); weakness from the gap between phenomenon and thing, which the hyperobject makes disturbingly visible; and lameness from the fact that all entities are fragile (as a condition of possibility for their existence), and hyperobjects make this fragility conspicuous",,445
12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"A baby vomits curdled milk. She learns to distinguish between the vomit and the not-vomit, and comes to know the not-vomit as self.12 Every subject is formed at the expense of some viscous, slightly poisoned substance, possibly teeming with bacteria, rank with stomach acid. The parent scoops up the mucky milk in a tissue and flushes the wadded package down the toilet. Now we know where it goes. For some time we may have thought that the U-bend in the toilet was a convenient curvature of ontological space that took whatever we flush down it into a totally different dimension called Away",,592
12/28/2022,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),Timothy Morton,"Some days, global warming fails to heat me up. It is strangely cool or violently stormy. My intimate sensation of prickling heat at the back of my neck is only a distorted print of the hot hand of global warming. I do not feel at home in the biosphere. Yet it surrounds me and penetrates me, like the Force in Star Wars. The more I know about global warming, the more I realize how pervasive it is. The more I discover about evolution, the more I realize how my entire physical being is caught in its meshwork. Immediate, intimate symptoms of hyperobjects are vivid and often painful, yet they carry with them a trace of unreality",,630

This knocks you down, and you must grope for a new path, since the light in that joyful fire has completely gone out for you.

12/11/2022,Semiotics: The Basics,Daniel Chandler,"what semiotics has discovered … is that the law governing or, if one prefers, the major constraint affecting any social practice lies in the fact that it signifies; i.e. that it is articulated like a language",,208

12/11/2022,Semiotics: The Basics,Daniel Chandler,His signified is not to be identified directly with such a referent but is a concept in the mind – not a thing but the notion of a thing. Some people may wonder why Saussures model of the sign refers only to a concept and not to a thing,,236
12/11/2022,Semiotics: The Basics,Daniel Chandler,"Symbols are not proxy for their objects but are vehicles for the conception of objects … In talking about things we have conceptions of them, not the things themselves; and it is the conceptions, not the things, that symbols directly mean",,238
12/11/2022,Semiotics: The Basics,Daniel Chandler,"Furthermore, being immaterial, language is an extraordinarily economical medium and words are always ready to hand. Nevertheless, a principled argument can be made for the revaluation of the materiality of the sign, as we shall see in due course",,245
12/11/2022,Semiotics: The Basics,Daniel Chandler,A sign is a recognizable combination of a signifier with a particular signified.

11/26/2022,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),Jan Verwoert,"What further serves to frame these themes as genre motifs and create a certain distance towards them is Aders conceptual choice to select motifs and media that are, if not openly nostalgic, at least decidedly uncontemporary",,223
11/26/2022,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),Jan Verwoert,"It is, after all, one of the merits of Aders work that it disentangles the concept of the romantic act from its coercive ties to a belief system, and thereby makes it possible to reconsider the idea, intellectually as well as emotionally",,237
11/26/2022,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),Jan Verwoert,"This attitude manifests itself, for instance, in the melancholic humour with which Ader traces the romantic sublime in the banalities of the Coasters lyrics, and thereby proves that the sublime and the banal are today each others flipside",,238

8/17/2022,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,Alexander Dumbadze,"But what perhaps caught Aders attention more than anything was Manrys utter ordinariness. He was in appearance and lifestyle an unspectacular individual, a solid and upstanding citizen who dutifully got along",,208
8/17/2022,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,Alexander Dumbadze,"But to think of the piece as complete—made such by events known only to Ader—allows one to understand it as offering a reorientation of the conception of an artwork, how it is constituted, and how it communicates",,212
8/17/2022,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,Alexander Dumbadze,"What was to make Aders upcoming sail unique was its absolute singularity. It had the potential to be an experience that defied representation. To emphasize that point, to in essence portray that which cannot be represented, Aders Copley show had to be extravagant. It had to make explicit the relation between absence and presence",,330

8/17/2022,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,Alexander Dumbadze,"The central appeal of the voyage was that it could not be captured adequately in words or images. Ader could depict it, of course; he could explain in great detail the daily travails of his crossing. But neither effort would close the representational gap his voyage inherently entailed.

The eventual reception of Aders art suggests that under the right conditions it can",,381
8/17/2022,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,Alexander Dumbadze,"Aders sail was not a performance. There was nothing staged, something Goldstein, even many years after the fact, could not comprehend: The difference between Bas Jan and me is that I wouldnt have to take that boat trip; a flyer would have been enough. He came out of a time when the artist had to be involved in making a piece; he physically had to make the journey, while I would have treated it as pure theater, so a publication would have been enough",,453
8/17/2022,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,Alexander Dumbadze,"The distinction between such projects by Burden, Goldstein, and Ruppersberg and Aders is obvious: Aders peers mostly made representations; In Search of the Miraculous was something else. Aders body was never found, and three years after Ocean Wave was recovered he was legally declared lost at sea. It is impossible to know what happened to him. No records survive that could shed light on the tragic event; the camera and tape recorder he took with him disappeared as well",,473
8/17/2022,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,Alexander Dumbadze,"He makes an initial choice as to the constitution of his piece, and from that point forward fate runs its course. To a certain degree, what Burden describes is akin to the way Sol LeWitt devised instructions for wall drawings, which assistants would execute following the logic of his directions. There are many other instances of what might be considered an elision of subjectivity, where authorial voice—for example, that of Lawrence Weiner or On Kawara—was obviated by rule-based systems that depersonalized the work of art",,526
8/17/2022,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,Alexander Dumbadze,"Condillac argues that writing forges an insoluble link between the text and an author who is no longer present once the act of reading commences. The authenticity of the original thought continues without modification in the written document. Derrida finds flaws in this formulation, especially when considering the mechanisms that underpin written communication. He contends that for a written statement to function it must be able to communicate without recourse to the authors presence. Yet this is just half of the equation, since Derrida is also wary of written communication that may be understood only by the addresser and the intended addressee. A situation such as this demands a specific addressee, and the lack of his or her presence invariably makes the writing unintelligible. Writing, as Derrida describes, has always operated independently, for if it is to communicate, it must be able to function in spite of those who write and read. This is how it signifies in the moment as well as in the future. This also means that what writing represents is contingent, that the written text is not a direct conduit to presence, that in its state of signification it is the thing itself",,1192

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,Just point and pull the trigger. Youll hit something,,52
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Is this my assimilation, so many years in the making?",,53

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,He had a good wife and strong boys. What did he want from this country?,,71
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,So focused on his own life. He couldnt understand anything about rights,,71

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"This, she reminded me almost nightly, was his true courage and sacrifice",,72

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Sometimes, when he wanted to hide or not outright lie, he chose to speak in English",,83
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,Something in me wants to crush him but I dont move. I think I cant bear his inaction,,84
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"and so they singsong it to me, to slay me, subdue me, this very first of their lyrics",,85
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"The constant cry is that you belong here, or you make yourself belong, or you must go",,85
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"so we could hear the sound of his sleeping, his breathing, ours, that strange conspiring",,88

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,He couldnt care for the importance of career. That notion was too costly for a man like him,,91

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"every betrayal dwells a self-betrayal, which brings you that much closer to a reckoning. * * *",,94

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I asked what his company researched. The one thing worth researching, he casually replied. People",,97

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,How worn and weak. He was forever there to let me know every disadvantage I would have to overcome,,98
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"their looks as they check again that my voice moves in time with my mouth, truly belongs to my face",,99
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I figured, she said. Come on, sweetie. Whats going on? You should say. You should tell your only wife",,101
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"the three of us, looking like a family accident, gathering on the counter the most serendipitous pile",,101
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Lelia was quiet to this. Its incredible, isnt it, she then said, that its so clear what we get from them?",,105
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"My citizenship is an accident of birth, my mother delivering me on this end of a long plane ride from Seoul",,107

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"You look like someone listening to himself. You pay attention to what youre doing. If I had to guess, youre not a native speaker",,128
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,He was old-fashioned enough that he believed he needed proper intellectual training and expertise before he could serve the public,,130

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Perhaps he sees something meaningful, how this might be a test and a recompense. If you must walk the white-hot stones, touch each one",,134
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"But then marriage must be the willingness to walk the blind alleys. Maybe I know that now. You dont tempt fate, you ignore it completely",,136

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"And yet I am bestowed only with the meager effect of his hard-fought riches, that troubling awe and contempt and piety I still hold for his life",,144
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I remember my father saying, Your eyes all led, staring at me after Id smoked pot the first time, and I went to my room and laughed until I wept",,144
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Well, come on! You sound like you want trouble tonight. Why dont you ask me about Eduardo and his apartment? You are the only one left who hasnt!",,145
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Mixed-up memory, hunger. It was like lonesome old dogs, all wags and tongues and worn eyes. This was the woman I promised to love. This is my wife",,146
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Then, another idea suddenly hits me: that I am searching out the raw spots in him, the places where he appears open, where the wounds are still fresh",,149
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"He didnt, not caring much for politics or politicians. But you know, he said, hes not like all the other Koreans around here, all tense and everything",,150
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Thank God, for her sake. She deserved to hurl whatever was available, to keep us moving, to speak in counterpoint to the deadening strings of my pyrrhic feet",,157
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,I dont get you two. Is this Korean? Youre so brutal. Why dont you just ask the manager for a knife and then see how much of your blood you can offer each other?,,160
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"She wants them to know that there is nothing to fear, she wants to offer up a pale white woman horsing with the language to show them its fine to mess it all up",,160
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"You are your cheapest labor. Here is the great secret, the great mystery to an immigrants success, the dwindle of irredeemable hours beneath the cheap tube lights",,162
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I am conscious of how right he appears to me, how perfect, every one of his tones and gestures dead on, not simply what I expect but what I want desperately to see",,163
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"One entire tape was Mitt saying every bad word he knew. I had to wonder about his expensive private-school yard. The worst bad word, he whispered, was motherfucker",,163
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"When youre too careful you cant say anything. You cant imagine the play of the words in your head. You cant hear them, and they all sound like they belong to somebody else",,171
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"For how do you trail someone who keeps you so close? How do you write of one who tells you more stories than you need to know? Where do you begin, and where are you able to end?",,177
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"You are the model by which they will work and live. You are their hope. And all this because you are such a natural American, first thing and last, if something other in between",,177
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"gets at your outline instead of your live center, you think hes really stepping back as he approaches, stepping back inside and back away from you so nothing can get around or behind him",,186
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I am here for the hope of his identity, which may also be mine, who he has been on a public scale when the rest of us wanted only security in the tiny dollar shops and churches of our lives",,189
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Henry Park, her voice would quiver. Please recite our favorite verse. Id choke, stumble inside myself. And this was her therapy, struck in sublime meter on my palms and the backs of my calves:",,192
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"For what I have done with my life is the darkest version of what he only dreamed of, to enter a place and tender the native language with body and tongue and have no one turn and point to the door",,196
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"She was always surging ahead of where we were, never staying with one notion for too long, and I willingly followed her wherever she needed to go, off the real subject, maybe pushed her there myself",,198
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Luck, like most everything else, must be a Chinese invention. We Koreans have reinvented the idea of luck as mostly bad, and try to do everything we can to prevent it. We fear leaving anything to chance",,202
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"That woman? She has been hurting me! Do you know that? She and that dog Jenkins would have me bow down before every cheat and beggar in this city. Who is left? You? Should I get on my knees to you, too?",,202
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I can see that he is hurt, the instant hang in his expression. How his American life shows through so clearly. Another Korean man of his generation would not forgive the moment so quickly, if ever at all",,203
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Luckily, the school officials we check in with dont seem to care. They greet her and then look at me and dont ask questions. They can figure I am part of her materials, the days curriculum. Show and tell",,203
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Lelia had great trouble accepting this stunning ignorance of mine. That summer, when it seemed she was thinking about it, she would stare in wonderment at me as if I had a gaping hole blown through my head",,205
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"The men Ive been with have this idea to make me over. I feel like a rock in some boys polishing kit. I go in dull, scratched up, and then rumble rumble whirr, Im supposed to come out precious and sparkling again",,211
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"That I no longer can simply flash a light inside a character, paint a figure like Kwang with a momentary language, but that I know the greater truths reside in our necessary fictions spanning human event and time?",,213
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"He possessed a certain grace with the glass in his hand, the way hed hold himself with it thrust toward the ocean like one mans saving beacon, the dying yellow light hitting it from behind him and sparking the amber",,215
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"And where he began to think of America as a part of him, maybe even his, and this for me was the crucial leap of his character, deep flaw or not, the leap of his identity no one in our work would find valuable but me",,216
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"My self-conception was that I was frail. I would sometimes affect similar ailments to my mothers and try to mimic her, stay in my room whole weekends with a pile of picture books or puzzles, never changing out of my pajamas",,223
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"When you are someone like me, you will be many people all at once. You are a father, a dictator, a servant, the most agile actor this land has ever known. And all throughout you must be the favorite chaste love of the people",,224
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"But I dont, I say. Ive forgotten how, if I ever knew. Then, when someone like Kwang attempts anything larger, theres instant suspicion. Someone must step up and pay to send in us hyenas. Well sniff him out. We eat our own, you know",,231
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I wouldnt eat or sleep at a friends house if it werent prearranged. I never assumed anyone would be generous to me, or in any way helpful. I never considered it my right to expect approval or sanction no matter what good I had done",,231
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I found the coin in the back flap pocket of his shorts. The coin was warm—the bag must have been left near a window—and I wondered how long the shiny metal could hold in a heat, if it could remember something like the press of flesh",,232
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Now, keep thinking. Think for keeps. Then, isolate the wonderments, the curiosities of his death; they will help you to see. Shed sentimentality. Stop this falling in love with fate. Reside, if you can, in the last place of the dead",,232
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"George Washington Park. He was practicing the writing of his signature. And then, the woman begins to shift her consciousness from the dead father to the absent son, her husband. Is it the coldness of objects, she wonders, that persists?",,237
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Later, to tell him something else, Id place a larger bouquet than his on my mothers grave. I drove only used, beat-up cars. I never asked him for his money. I spoke volumes to him this way, speak to him still, those same volumes he spoke with me",,245
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Maybe this. This. Why you find yourself here in this silly room with a man like me, rather than at home in bed with your beautiful wife. Why you are one of us. I look at you and see someone who could have done whatever he wished in life. Any career",,248
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I nodded, looking away from her. Then she reached for my cheek, her cool fingertips on my skin. I leaned into them. I took her hand and held it to my face, against my mouth. At that moment I almost wished for something like smothering myself with her",,250
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"You were solemn and dignified. Remember? Thats who you were for about a year. The bowing, the white-glove bit. Youre the one who calmly explained to everyone how well we were doing. Of course I was the mad and stupid one. The crazy white lady in the attic",,255
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Later, after he died, Id try it again, ride the train with Lelia to the same restaurant and store, but in the end we would separately wander the aisles not looking for anything, except at the last moment, when we finally encountered each other, who was not him",,260
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,You were well raised. You have a keen sense of accommodation. This is clear. You understand respect and distance and separateness. Fine things. But someplace in your life you let them go too far. Too far for any more good to come of them. The result is foregone,,261
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I will not rid my expression of the sudden worry and weight. I will not hush or so handle my heart. I will put my hand in her hair. Kiss her ear. Now whisper a speech with my smallest voice. She whispers back, this blessing we share. Now I think we will both dream of fire",,272
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I asked her not to make a scene of it, and I could see that she was about to shout out but then just as quickly she quelled herself—a trick perhaps that she had gleaned from me—and whispered sharply that if I wanted to wait I had better be willing to talk about adoption again",,276
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I think I can bear silence from anyone but him. I want him to stand up and show his face and say something for Eduardo. And for a moment I feel that hot ore of my fathers rage, what would sometimes drive him like disease or madness to hack like a demon at wet sod in the backyard",,279
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"For the first few assignments you feel perfectly transparent, as if the man or woman in question can witness every leap of your heart. You think they can sense every false move. But in successive turns you grow an opacity, a pearl-like glow whose surface can repel all manner of heat and light",,293
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I remember how I sat with him in those restaurants, both of us eating without savor, unjoyous, and my wanting to show him that I could be as steely as he, my chin as rigid and unquivering as any of his displays, that I would tolerate no mysteries either, no shadowy wounds or scars of the heart",,294
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Instantly I was thinking of the lover she might want, the man whom shed searched out but hadnt yet found in her life. I thought of the ways Nils was perhaps falling short. I put myself in her place and imagined her father and mother. Boyfriends, recent loves. I made those phantom calculations, did all that",,307
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Theres nothing you have to say. I just wonder, thats all. This woman has given twenty years of her life to you and your father and it still seems like she could be anyone to you. It doesnt seem to matter who she is. Right? If your father switched her now with someone else, probably nothing would be different",,309
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"His practice was healthy, built up now for many years, and I could tell it was all adding up to the prime of his life, that noble time, a period that my father seemed to squeeze down to a few scant minutes around midnight, sitting with a beer in front of his projection TV, absently chuckling at wrestlers and clowns",,316
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"What you really want from me. I dont know what you need in life. For example, do you need your job? Im not understanding what you mean by need. See what I mean? she shouted. You know, I really honestly thought about it for the first time in Corsica, I mean really thought about what you do up there with your friends",,316
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Thats much better, you! Why not yell at me? Ill allow it. Dont think of me as elder; come, strike out at me with your words, or something else. This is America, we can do this. Say it in English if you have to. Get it out in the open. You want this. I am not your father. I am not your friend. Come on, I will survive",,317
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"His parents came from a slum in Athens, no place near those magnificent columns of chalky rock, and I could imagine that his mother and father were just like him, thick-fingered people of the earth, human weeds, hardened and sad and always ready to burst from the drab husks of their lives with great quaking fits of emotion",,324
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Right. Anyway, I dont care what they look like. No offense. I thought about it and I dont really give a damn if they look like a goddamn UNICEF poster, though I think theyll probably be damn nice to look at. You two think about it. A little baby granddaughter, or grandson. Anyhow, just make some babies, for the old folks. Make some babies for us",,347
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I used to wish that I were more like my Jewish and Italian friends, or even the black kids who hung out in front of my fathers stores; I was envious of how theyd speak so confidently, so jubilantly celebrate the fact with their hands and hips and tongues, letting it all hang out (though of course in different ways) for anybody whod look and listen",,349
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"When real trouble hits, I lock up. I cant work the trusty calculus. I cant speak. I sit there, unmoved. For a person like Lelia, who grew up with hollerers and criers, mine is the worst response. It must look as if Im not even trying. Unless I drink too much Ill eventually recede. I go into my fathers act, though she only knows this from what Ive told her",,357
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I listened to the tapes tonight, I said, trying not to sound sentimental. I decided to wander over. I bet, she said, crossing her arms. Though I doubt youve ever really wandered. I wander a lot. Oh, thats good, she replied. But only in the place and time of your choosing. The word for that is invasion. So shoot me. She cocked her thumb and aimed right between my eyes. Pow",,374
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"In profile, you saw the same blunt line descend the back of their necks, those high, flat ears, but then little else because Lelia—or maybe her father—had endowed Mitt with that other, potent sprawl of limbs, those round, vigilant eyes, the upturned ancestral nose (like a scriveners, in my imagination), his boys form already so beautifully jumbled and subversive and historic",,377
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"And sometimes I will write them out now, again, though for myself, those old strokes, unofficial versions of any newcomer I see in the street or on the bus or in the demi-shops of the city, the need in me still to undo the cipherlike faces scrawled with hard work, and no work, and all trouble. The faces of my father and his workers, and Ahjuhma, and the ever-dimming one of my mother",,385
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"But I can imagine my father saying his no, no, it was clearly Kwangs Confucian training at work, his secular religion of pure hierarchy, his belief that everyone is at once a noble and a servant and then just a man. Its adherents know no hubris. Instead this: you simply bow down before those who would honor you. You honor them back. For you are but ash to their fire. All spent of light",,388
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"He was how I imagined a Korean would be, at least one living in any renown. He would stride the daises and the stages with his voice strong and clear, unafraid to speak the language like a Puritan and like a Chinaman and like every boat person in between. I found him most moving and beautiful in those moments. And whenever I hear the strains of a different English, I will still shatter a little inside",,404
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"We will learn every lesson of accent and idiom, we will dismantle every last pretense and practice you hold, noble as well as ruinous. You can keep nothing safe from our eyes and ears. This is your own history. We are your most perilous and dutiful brethren, the song of our hearts at once furious and sad. For only you could grant me these lyrical modes. I call them back to you. Here is the sole talent I ever dared nurture",,425
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"He has sung whole love songs to the cynical crowds, told tall stories of courage and honor, doing all this without any mythic display, without savvy, almost embarrassing the urban throng. They would look up at him from their seats and see he was serious and then quietly make certain to themselves that this was still the country they grew up in. They had never imagined a man like him, an American like him. But no one ever left",,429
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"He could pass for twenty-four. Hes pleasant of face, not so much handsome as he is gentle-looking, and pink of cheek; he only shaves in spots. His gait is casual and patient and straight. Hes not looking at anything in particular, his gaze too fair. Too fair all around, as though he couldnt offend anybody. So he looks friendly, he looks like hed be willing to talk to you, but really because of the way his gaze circles about you",,431
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Americans, one of them would say, are a wonderful and exuberant people. They dance, they play-fight, they puff up their lips and blow out their chests. They enjoy using their hands. They seem to live always at a football match. They stand in broken columns and flurry with both arms and both legs and they are not afraid to make a mess of themselves. They dont so much sing as they do chant. Chanting is more satisfying, at least how they do",,441
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"So I hung up, she said. I havent spoken to him since before that. I never understood how he could just drop me like that. Is it a Korean thing? I mean, what kind of person does that? Except for the very end, everything was great between us. We had great sex, too, and that doesnt happen a lot in college. But now I have to think none of it was very good. It was like hed done his time with me, with a white girl, and then it was over. I almost still hate him. Asshole",,467
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Its like the most awful and sad opera, the strong music of his English, then her black English; her colorful, almost elevated, mocking of him, and his grim explosions. They fight like lovers, scarred, knowing. Their song circular and vicious. For she always comes back the next day, and so does he. Its like they are here to torture each other. He cant afford a store anywhere else but where she lives, and she has no other place to buy a good apple or a fresh loaf of bread",,474
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"My father was obviously not modern, in the psychological sense. He was still mostly unencumbered by those needling questions of existence and self-consciousness. Irony was always lost on him. He was the definition of a thick skin. For most of my youth I wasnt sure that he had the capacity to love. He showed great respect to my mother to the day she died—I was ten—and practiced for her the deepest sense of duty and honor, but I never witnessed from him a devotion I could call love",,484
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"And yet you may know me. I am an amiable man. I can be most personable, if not charming, and whatever I possess in this life is more or less the result of a talent I have for making you feel good about yourself when you are with me. In this sense I am not a seducer. I am hardly seen. I wont speak untruths to you, I wont pass easy compliments or odious offerings of flattery. I make do with on-hand materials, what I can chip out of you, your natural ore. Then I fuel the fire of your most secret vanity",,504
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I tried to answer but I couldnt. I wanted to explain myself, smartly, irrefutably. But once again I had nothing to offer. I had always thought that I could be anyone, perhaps several anyones at once. Dennis Hoagland and his private firm had conveniently appeared at the right time, offering the perfect vocation for the person I was, someone who could reside in his one place and take half-steps out whenever he wished. For that I felt indebted to him for life. I found a sanction from our work, for I thought I had finally found my truest place in the culture",,560
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I compared these to some of the other moments that I remembered her saying it, the night we decided to live together, the morning after Mitt was born, the time drunk in a bar when she thought I had been sleeping with another woman. I never felt comfortable with the phrase, had a deep trouble with it, all the ways it was said. You could say it in a celebratory sense. For corroboration. In gratitude. To get a point across, to instill guilt in your lover, to defend yourself. You said it after great deliberation, or when you felt reckless. You said it when you meant it and sometimes when you didnt. You somehow always said it when you had to",,644
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"What threw me most, however, was that he would sometimes misremember whether I had children—this seems improbable, given what I would learn about his amazing feats of memory—and while talking about child rearing he might refer to how I must know this thing or that, the way a child can be joyous and harrowing, ask of what I imagined in life for my daughter or my son. When he over-drank he wanted to see pictures. I had to tell him I didnt carry any. He would open his wallet and show me snapshots of his own children, Peter and John Jr., in matching blue suits. He also carried a picture of May, though it dated to the sixties (her hair, her dress) and was nearly faded of all color",,684
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Now, as the first front door opened, I spoke calmly and severely, explaining the situation as one of gravity but not crisis. But then, at the sight of the offending boy, the old man behind me inexplicably exploded, chopping the air with his worn fingers, cursing red-faced like a cheated peasant in our throaty mother tongue until the bewildered child began to cry. His mother protested meekly (you could tell she knew my father) and I, too, wanted him to stop yelling, to shut up and let me speak. Instead I allowed myself to sacrifice this boy and his mother, perhaps even myself, and let the old man yell this one bloody murder, if only for Mitt. I know this: a child doesnt forgive or forget—he works it out",,711
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I remember thinking of her, Whats she afraid of, what could be so bad that we had to be that careful of what people thought of us, as if we ought to mince delicately about in pained feet through our immaculate neighborhood, we silent partners of the bordering WASPs and Jews, never rubbing them except with a smile, as if everything with us were always all right, in our great sham of propriety, as if nothing could touch us or wreak anger or sadness upon us.

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"We lay down together but we werent touching. Her eyes were closed, though just barely, the lids frail and milky and almost transparent in the dim light. The heat of her face, her throat, drew me closer to her and the tiny hairs on my cheeks and brow tingled from the nearness. For it was nearness and not touch that had always compelled me. I have only known proximity. She didnt move away. I didnt try to touch her. I knew I shouldnt. I just closed my eyes, and I slid to her until I could feel the warmth of my own face play back against hers, the reflection like an instant map of heat. I thought I could read every contour of her skin and bone, every relief of her flesh. What it all said. As if I could ever read her mind",,726
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Its my brand of sloth, surely, that I could fail my wife so miserably but seem to provide all the necessary objects and affections. On paper, by any known standard, I was an impeccable mate. I did everything well enough. I cooked well enough, cleaned enough, was romantic and sensitive and silly enough, I made love enough, was paternal, big brotherly, just a good friend enough, father-to-my-son enough, forlorn enough, and then even bull-headed and dull and macho enough, to make it all seamless. For ten years she hadnt realized the breadth of what I had accomplished with my exacting competence, the daily work I did, which unto itself became an unassailable body of cover. And the surest testament to the magnificent and horrifying level of my virtuosity was that neither had I",,782
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Say, Lelia tells me your father is a fine businessman. Absolute best, I said, taking a long sip. He had to be, he replied. No one was going to help him if he failed. I wish I had spoken to him more at the wedding. I saw a man who didnt have to make a display of himself. You knew he walked every inch to where he is. He owes no one, and he cant conceive of being owed something. Thats the problem with us right now, its that we have a country here of people, both rich and poor, who think theyre entitled to everything good in life. I read a newspaper article about a young couple with two small children. You know the story. Hot-dog gumbo for dinner. Of course, neither of them is working. Theyre on welfare and food stamps but they still somehow have enough money for cable and long distance. They tell the reporter they need them",,832
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"Sherrie Chin-Watt. Chinese American, born in San Francisco. Berkeley B.A. Did her law degree at Boalt. Law Review. Her parents run a small wig shop. Nothing special. Shes around your age, Harry, thirty-three or thirty-four. Was married last year to your garden-variety investment banker, corporate finance. Her first marriage, his second. He works too much, sixty, sixty-five hours a week. Headed for the grave. Again nothing special, no real angle there for us. They own a co-op on Central Park West and a bungalow out in East Hampton. No children as yet. She suffers from endometriosis. Whered you get that? I asked. Im friendly with a prominent gynecologist. Coincidence. Jesus. She had a successful laser surgery last year, though shes not pregnant yet. They sleep in separate rooms because he snores. Other items. They went to Morocco for their honeymoon. They usually eat out, though not together. She lettered in volleyball in high school. Solid setter. She still calls home twice a week. What else?

8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I dont have any deep problems with her. I know this must sound spiteful. She has her shortcomings, certainly, but I wont go into them because once you start ticking things off they just keep going until they take on a life of their own, which neither truth nor good intention can withstand. What will I say? Lelia is mostly wonderful. And lovely. She has a prominent nose that seems just right and slightly off kilter at the same time. Her eyes are wide-set. She doesnt much fuss with her hair. When you hand her a football she instantly spins it to the laces and says, Go out. Each morning she rises at 6:30 and stretches in her underwear and makes a good pot of coffee. She always scalds the milk. I go in the kitchen and believe I will never see a more perfect set of hip bones. Or uglier feet. I know how her voice will sound with the first word of the day, not as low as it should be and as spare and clean as light. That effortless pitch. When she play-acts, horses around, she is silly and awkward, completely unconvincing. She must be the worst actor on earth. And perhaps most I loved this about her, her helpless way, love it still, how she cant hide a single thing, that she looks hurt when she is hurt, seems happy when happy. That I know at every moment the precise place where she stands. What else can move a man like me, who would find nothing as siren or comforting?",,1383
8/4/2022,Native Speaker,Chang-rae Lee,"I told him how I didnt know the subtle nuances or meanings of Korean names, even though I knew quite a few, that it would have been like naming someone purely by sound. And he wouldnt want an American name, because everybody else had one, because it was all so ordinary, even if convenient. I described him for the doctor, his walking before me in the schoolyard, stamping the blacktop, announcing our presence with his swagger, his shout. He knew karate, kung fu, tae kwon do, jujitsu. He could beat up the big black kids if he wished, the tough Puerto Rican kids, anyone else who called us names or made slanty eyes. The white boys admired him for his athleticism, how far past the fence he could send a kickball. The white girls were especially fond of him. He often kissed them after school, in front of everyone. He knew all about science, about model rocketry, chemistry sets, baseball cards, about American history. He was the lead in the school play. He spoke a singing beautiful English. He made public speeches. My mother and father were so proud of him. He was better than anyone. He was perfect. In my imagination these blinding halos of terror and beauty rung him, or maybe they were the same, as though he were limited somehow by his own unbearable preeminence and in that way given over to a doom in his life. In the daytime I could feel him near me, sense not so much his friendship but his vigilance and guidance, the veil of his cover. But at night, alone in my bed, my stomach would burn, ache anxiously for his well-being. I feared he would perish in some accident wherever he was (when he didnt need to be with me), that he was going to die tragically, drown in a lake or slip and fall off a cliff; it wouldnt be his fault, it wouldnt be anyones, just that it would happen without warning or reason. And soon Id find myself knotted into a hard coil in the bed, the points of my knees jabbing back the stabs of worry in my stomach and chest, and I wondered if in the morning after I left the house for the long walk to school he would be there for me, at my flank again, that comely wall of him, talking his trash and his resplendence, talking me up, too, talking my story.

There are many varieties of altered states of consciousness. Most people think enlightenment is some altered state of consciousness. This is a profound misunderstanding. Enlightenment is the natural state of consciousness, the innocent state of consciousness, that state which is uncontaminated by the movement of thought, uncontaminated by control or manipulation of mind",,718

Manipulation is a strong word, but I am using it to get your attention, to call attention to the fact that when we sit down to meditate and ask ourselves, Okay, how am I going to control my mind? How am I going to come to peace? How am I going to come to stillness?, what the mind is actually doing is asking, How do I control myself so that I feel better? And you can learn to control your mind and quiet your mind and your body by applying a controlling technique. For a while it might feel good. But when we control our minds in order to obtain a certain state of peace or tranquility, its very much like getting someone to be quiet by taping their mouth shut. Youve succeeded in getting that person to be quiet, but youve done it through a very manipulative technique. What good will come of getting that person to be quiet by taping their mouth shut?

Medications can restore homeostasis, but consider what we lose by medicating away our pain. Pressing on the pain side resets our balance to the side of pleasure. Beware of getting addicted to pain. Radical honesty promotes awareness, enhances intimacy, and fosters a plenty mindset. Prosocial shame affirms that we belong to the human tribe.

4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,The value of our activity depends almost entirely on the humility to accept ourselves as we are. The reason why we do things so badly is that we are not content to do what we can,,178
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"But, above all, we must learn our own weakness in order to awaken to a new order of action and of being—and experience God Himself accomplishing in us the things we find impossible",,180
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"One who is content with what he has, and who accepts the fact that he inevitably misses very much in life, is far better off than one who has much more but who worries about all he may be missing",,195
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"Tidal waves of nonentity, of powerlessness, of hopelessness surge up within him at every action he attempts. Then the shadow judges and hates the shadow who is not a god, and who can do absolutely nothing",,204
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"No matter how ruined man and his world may seem to be, and no matter how terrible mans despair may become, as long as he continues to be a man his very humanity continues to tell him that life has a meaning",,206
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"Yet knowing this much, and indeed knowing all moral theology and ethics and canon law, I might still go through life conforming myself to certain indications of Gods will without ever fully giving myself to God",,210
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"Some people find, in the end, that they have made many wrong guesses and that their paradoxical vocation is to go through life guessing wrong. It takes them a long time to find out that they are happier that way",,211
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,It is useless to try to make peace with ourselves by being pleased with everything we have done. In order to settle down in the quiet of our own being we must learn to be detached from the results of our own activity,,216
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"St. Paul teaches (II Thessalonians 3) that Christian humility and asceticism should normally help us to lead quite ordinary lives, peacefully earning our bread and working from day to day in a world that will pass away",,218
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"We do not live merely in order to do something—no matter what. Activity is just one of the normal expressions of life, and the life it expresses is all the more perfect when it sustains itself with an ordered economy of action",,226
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"Love is perfect in proportion to its freedom. It is free in proportion to its purity. We act most freely when we act purely in response to the love of God. But the purest love of God is not servile, not blind, not limited by fear",,229
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"I can see my eyes in a mirror. My soul can also reflect itself in the mirror of its own activity. But what is seen in the mirror is only the reflection of who I am, not my true being. The mirror of words and actions only partly manifests my being",,246
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"It is, therefore, a very great thing to be little, which is to say: to be ourselves. And when we are truly ourselves we lose most of the futile self-consciousness that keeps us constantly comparing ourselves with others in order to see how big we are",,250
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"Solitude, humility, self-denial, action and contemplation, the sacraments, the monastic life the family and of these make sense except in relation to the central reality which is Gods love living and acting in those whom He has incorporated in His Christ",,254
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"By salvation I mean first of all the full discovery of who he himself really is. Then I mean something of the fulfillment of his own God-given powers, in the love of others and of God. I mean also the discovery that he cannot find himself in himself alone",,255
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"brother. This division cannot be healed by a love that places itself only on one side of the rift. Love must reach over to both sides and draw them together. We cannot love ourselves unless we love others, and we cannot love others unless we love ourselves",,256
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"We cannot master everything, taste everything, understand everything, drain every experience to its last dregs. But if we have the courage to let almost everything else go, we will probably be able to retain the one thing necessary for us—whatever it may be",,257
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"The relative perfection which we must attain to in this life if we are to live as sons of God is not the twenty-four-hour-a-day production of perfect acts of virtue, but a life from which practically all the obstacles to Gods love have been removed or overcome",,260
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"The saint, therefore, is sanctified not only by fasting when he should fast but also by eating when he should eat. He is not only sanctified by his prayers in the darkness of the night, but by the sleep that he takes in obedience to God, Who made us what we are",,261
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,Gratitude and confidence and freedom from ourselves: these are signs that we have found our vocation and are living up to it even though everything else may seem to have gone wrong. They give us peace in any suffering. They teach us to laugh at despair. And we may have to,,272
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"One of the chief obstacles to this perfection of selfless charity is the selfish anxiety to get the most out of everything, to be a brilliant success in our own eyes and in the eyes of other men. We can only get rid of this anxiety by being content to miss something in almost everything we do",,293
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"But the purity of our conscience has a natural proportion with the depth of our being and the quality of our acts: and when our activity is habitually disordered, our malformed conscience can think of nothing better to tell us than to multiply the quantity of our acts, without perfecting their quality",,302
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"The freedom that is exercised in the choice of priestly vocations is a mystery hidden in God, a mystery that reaches out of the obscurity of Gods Providence to select, sometimes, unlikely men to be other Christs and sometimes to reject those who are, in the eyes of men, best fitted for such a vocation",,302
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"If we really know ourselves we quietly take our proper place in the order designed by God. And so supernatural humility adds much to our human dignity by integrating us in the society of other men and placing us in our right relation to them and to God. Pride makes us artificial, and humility makes us real",,307
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"The only effective answer to the problem of salvation must therefore reach out to embrace both extremes of a contradiction at the same time. Hence that answer must be supernatural. That is why all the answers that are not supernatural are imperfect: for they only embrace one of the contradictory terms, and they can always be denied by the other",,346
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"In order to find God in ourselves, we must stop looking at ourselves, stop checking and verifying ourselves in the mirror of our own futility, and be content to be in Him and to do whatever He wills, according to our limitations, judging our acts not in the light of our own illusions, but in the light of His reality which is all around us in the things and people we live with",,378
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"Music is pleasing not only because of the sound but because of the silence that is in it: without the alternation of sound and silence there would be no rhythm. If we strive to be happy by filling all the silences of life with sound, productive by turning all lifes leisure into work, and real by turning all our being into doing, we will only succeed in producing a hell on earth",,380
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"We do not exist for ourselves alone, and it is only when we are fully convinced of this fact that we begin to love ourselves properly and thus also love others. What do I mean by loving ourselves properly? I mean, first of all, desiring to live, accepting life as a very great gift and a great good, not because of what it gives us, but because of what it enables us to give to others",,384
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"2. Do not stress too much the fact that love seeks to penetrate the intimate secrets of the beloved. Those who are too fond of this idea fall short of true love, because they violate the solitude of those they love, instead of respecting it. True love penetrates the secrets and the solitude of the beloved by allowing him to keep his secrets to himself and to remain in his own solitude",,387
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"The man who completely trusts his own estimate of himself is doomed to sterility. All he asks of any act he performs is that it be his act. If it is performed by him, it must be good. All words spoken by him must be infallible. The car he has just bought is the best for its price, for no other reason than that he is the one who has bought it. He seeks no other fruit than this, and therefore he generally gets no other",,420
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"They must struggle to escape their true being, and verify a false existence by constantly viewing what they themselves do. They have to keep looking in the mirror for reassurance. What do they expect to see? Not themselves! They are hoping for some sign that they have become the god they hope to become by means of their own frantic activity—invulnerable, all powerful, infinitely wise, unbearably beautiful, unable to die!",,424
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"We must be content to live without watching ourselves live, to work without expecting an immediate reward, to love without an instantaneous satisfaction, and to exist without any special recognition. It is only when we are detached from ourselves that we can be at peace with ourselves. We cannot find happiness in our work if we are always extending ourselves beyond ourselves and beyond the sphere of our work in order to find ourselves greater than we are",,458
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"All these three answers are insufficient. The third says we must love only ourselves. The second says we must love only another. The first says that in loving another we simply seek the most effective way to love ourselves. The true answer, which is supernatural, tells us that we must love ourselves in order to be able to love others, that we must find ourselves by giving ourselves to them. The words of Christ are clear: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself",,464
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"All vocations are intended by God to manifest His love in the world. For each special calling gives a man some particular place in the Mystery of Christ, gives him something to do for the salvation of all mankind. The difference between the various vocations lies in the different ways in which each one enables men to discover Gods love, appreciate it, respond to it, and share it with other men. Each vocation has for its aim the propagation of divine life in the world",,471
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"There is something in the depths of our being that hungers for wholeness and finality. Because we are made for eternal life, we are made for an act that gathers up all the powers and capacities of our being and offers them simultaneously and forever to God. The blind spiritual instinct that tells us obscurely that our own lives have a particular importance and purpose, and which urges us to find out our vocation, seeks in so doing to bring us to a decision that will dedicate our lives irrevocably to their true purpose",,523
4/11/2022,No Man Is an Island,Thomas Merton,"To love another is to will what is really good for him. Such love must be based on truth. A love that sees no distinction between good and evil, but loves blindly merely for the sake of loving, is hatred, rather than love. To love blindly is to love selfishly, because the goal of such love is not the real advantage of the beloved but only the exercise of love in our own souls. Such love cannot seem to be love unless it pretends to seek the good of the one loved. But since it actually cares nothing for the truth, and never considers that it may go astray, it proves itself to be selfish. It does not seek the true advantage of the beloved or even our own. It is not interested in the truth, but only in itself. It proclaims itself content with an apparent good: which is the exercise of love for its own sake, without any consideration of the good or bad effects of loving",,877

The only difference is theyre telling themselves they look good, and theyre letting themselves shine through. The people who say the most profound, intelligent, or witty things are the same as us.

Theyve pushed themselves through fearful situations and told themselves they could make it. The people who are successful are the same as us. Theyve gone ahead and developed their gifts and talents, and set goals for themselves. Were even the same as the people on television: our heroes, our idols. Were all working with approximately the same material—humanity. Its how we feel about ourselves that makes the difference. Its what we tell ourselves that makes the difference",,849

2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"When doing becomes infused with the timeless quality of Being, that is success. Unless Being flows into doing, unless you are present, you lose yourself in whatever you do",,171
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Who you are (consciousness), not who you think you are (a small me), would be responding. It would be powerful and effective and would make no person or situation into an enemy",,176
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Instead of trying to be a mountain, teaches the ancient Tao Te Ching, Be the valley of the universe.4 In this way, you are restored to wholeness and so all things will come to you.5",,181
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Then you look and you listen. Thus you become one with the situation. When instead of reacting against a situation, you merge with it, the solution arises out of the situation itself",,182
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Whatever you do takes time, and yet it is always now. So while your inner purpose is to negate time, your outer purpose necessarily involves future and so could not exist without time",,183
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Whatever you think the world is withholding from you, you are withholding from the world. You are withholding it because deep down you think you are small and that you have nothing to give",,188
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Be aware of your breathing as often as you are able, whenever you remember. Do that for one year, and it will be more powerfully transformative than attending all of these courses. And its free",,193
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"They equate truth with thought, and as they are completely identified with thought (their mind), they claim to be in sole possession of the truth in an unconscious attempt to protect their identity",,197
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"This is also the time when outer purpose—growth—tends to becomes usurped by the ego, which unlike nature does not know when to stop in its pursuit of expansion and has a voracious appetite for more",,197
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"If you are content with being nobody in particular, content not to stand out, you align yourself with the power of the universe. What looks like weakness to the ego is in fact the only true strength",,198
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"The present moment is always small in the sense that it is always simple, but concealed within it lies the greatest power. Like the atom, it is one of the smallest things yet contains enormous power",,198
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Did the woman return the ring, or had it been there all the time? Nobody will ever know. One thing we do know: Life will give you whatever experience is most helpful for the evolution of your consciousness",,205
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"fear, greed, and the desire for power are not the dysfunction that we are speaking of, but are themselves created by the dysfunction, which is a deep-seated collective delusion that lies within the mind of each human being",,222
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"the Latin word idem, meaning same and facere, which means to make. So when I identify with something, I make it the same. The same as what? The same as I. I endow it with a sense of self, and so it becomes part of my identity",,225
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"One of the unconscious assumptions is that by identifying with an object through the fiction of ownership, the apparent solidity and permanency of that material object will endow your sense of self with greater solidity and permanency",,234
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"It endows the world and the ego with a heaviness and an absolute importance that makes you take yourself and the world very seriously. The play of form is then misperceived as a struggle for survival, and when that is your perception, it becomes your reality",,258
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Inner purpose concerns Being and is primary. Outer purpose concerns doing and is secondary. While this book speaks mainly of your inner purpose, this chapter and the next will also address the question of how to align outer purpose and inner purpose in your life",,262
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Some of the change may be initiated by themselves, not through an agonizing decision-making process but by a sudden realization or recognition: This is what I have to do. The decision arrives ready-made, so to speak. It comes through awareness, not through thinking",,265
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"The ego identifies with having, but its satisfaction in having is a relatively shallow and short-lived one. Concealed within it remains a deep-seated sense of dissatisfaction, of incompleteness, of not enough. I dont have enough yet, by which the ego really means, I am not enough yet",,284
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"To refrain from identifying with the body doesnt mean that you neglect, despise, or no longer care for it. If it is strong, beautiful, or vigorous, you can enjoy and appreciate those attributes—while they last. You can also improve the bodys condition through right nutrition and exercise",,288
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Seeing the madness of our civilization so clearly, they may feel somewhat alienated from the culture around them. Some feel that they inhabit a no-mans-land between two worlds. They are no longer run by the ego, yet the arising awareness has not yet become fully integrated into their lives",,290
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"When you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place so that when your host comes, he may say to you, friend, move up higher. Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted",,292
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"There may also be things in our lives that we value because of their beauty or inherent quality. We need to honor the world of things, not despise it. Each thing has Beingness, is a temporary form that has its origin within the formless one Life, the source of all things, all bodies, all forms",,294
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"How are they reconciled? By realizing that your entire life journey ultimately consists of the step you are taking at this moment. There is always only this one step, and so you give it your fullest attention. This doesnt mean you dont know where you are going; it just means this step is primary, the destination secondary",,323
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"The decision to make the present moment into your friend is the end of the ego. The ego can never be in alignment with the present moment, which is to say, aligned with life, since its very nature compels it to ignore, resist, or devalue the Now. Time is what the ego lives on. The stronger the ego, the more time takes over your life",,334
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Is it wrong then to be proud of ones possessions or to feel resentful toward people who have more than you? Not at all. That sense of pride, of needing to stand out, the apparent enhancement of ones self through more than and diminishment through less than is neither right nor wrong—it is the ego. The ego isnt wrong; its just unconscious",,339
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Jesus goes on to say that if God clothes simple flowers in such beauty, how much more will God clothe you. That is to say, that while nature is a beautiful expression of the evolutionary impulse of the universe, when humans become aligned with the intelligence that underlies it, they will express that same impulse on a higher, more wondrous level",,348
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Whatever you do, you will be doing extraordinarily well, because the doing itself becomes the focal point of your attention. Your doing then becomes a channel through which consciousness enters this world. This means there is quality in what you do, even in the most simple action, like turning the pages in the phone book or walking across the room",,349
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"When faced with a radical crisis, when the old way of being in the world, of interacting with each other and with the realm of nature doesnt work anymore, when survival is threatened by seemingly insurmountable problems, an individual life-form—or a species—will either die or become extinct or rise above the limitations of its condition through an evolutionary leap",,367
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"The initiation of the awakening process is an act of grace. You cannot make it happen nor can you prepare yourself for it or accumulate credits toward it. There isnt a tidy sequence of logical steps that leads toward it, although the mind would love that. You dont have to become worthy first. It may come to the sinner before it comes to the saint, but not necessarily",,369
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"The illusion that you are separate from the power that runs the universe returns. You feel yourself to be alone again, struggling against something or trying to achieve this or that. But why did anxiety, stress, or negativity arise? Because you turned away from the present moment. And why did you do that? You thought something else was more important. You forgot your main purpose",,382
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"You need to be alert and honest to find out, for example, whether your sense of self-worth is bound up with things you possess. Do certain things induce a subtle feeling of importance or superiority? Does the lack of them make you feel inferior to others who have more than you? Do you casually mention things you own or show them off to increase your sense of worth in someone elses eyes and through them in your own?",,418
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"What is lost on the level of form is gained on the level of essence. In the traditional figure of the blind seer or the wounded healer of ancient cultures and legend, some great loss or disability on the level of form has become an opening into spirit. When you have had a direct experience of the unstable nature of all forms, you will likely never overvalue form again and thus lose yourself by blindly pursuing it or attaching yourself to it",,444
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"For many people, particularly in the West, death is no more than an abstract concept, and so they have no idea what happens to the human form when it approaches dissolution. Most decrepit and old people are shut away in nursing homes. Dead bodies, which in some older cultures are on open display for all to see, are hidden away. Try to see a dead body, and you will find that it is virtually illegal, except if the deceased is a close family member",,449
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Whatever you think people are withholding from you—praise, appreciation, assistance, loving care, and so on—give it to them. You dont have it? Just act as if you had it, and it will come. Then, soon after you start giving, you will start receiving. You cannot receive what you dont give. Outflow determines inflow. Whatever you think the world is withholding from you, you already have, but unless you allow it to flow out, you wont even know that you have it",,459
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"The modalities of awakened doing are acceptance, enjoyment, and enthusiasm. Each one represents a certain vibrational frequency of consciousness. You need to be vigilant to make sure that one of them operates whenever you are engaged in doing anything at all—from the most simple task to the most complex. If you are not in the state of either acceptance, enjoyment, or enthusiasm, look closely and you will find that you are creating suffering for yourself and others",,468
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"The separation of thinking and awareness, which lies at the core of your primary purpose, happens through the negation of time. We are not speaking here, of course, of the use of time for practical purposes, such as making an appointment or planning a trip. We are not speaking of clock time, but of psychological time, which is the minds deep-seated habit of seeking the fullness of life in the future where it cannot be found and ignoring the only point of access to it: the present moment",,491
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Would living like this not stop me from looking to achieve something great? My fear is that I will remain stuck with doing little things for the rest of my life, things that are of no consequence. Im afraid of never rising above mediocrity, never daring to achieve anything great, not fulfilling my potential. The great arises out of small things that are honored and cared for. Everybodys life really consists of small things. Greatness is a mental abstraction and a favorite fantasy of the ego",,495
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Such events represent the beginning of the return movement toward the dissolution of form. In most ancient cultures, there must have been an intuitive understanding of this process, which is why old people were respected and revered. They were the repositories of wisdom and provided the dimension of depth without which no civilization can survive for long. In our civilization, which is totally identified with the outer and ignorant of the inner dimension of spirit, the word old has mainly negative connotations",,515
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"You cannot make the egoless state into a future goal and then work toward it. All you get is more dissatisfaction, more inner conflict, because it will always seem that you have not arrived yet, have not attained that state yet. When freedom from ego is your goal for the future, you give yourself more time, and more time means more ego. Look carefully to find out if your spiritual search is a disguised form of ego. Even trying to get rid of your self can be a disguised search for more if the getting rid of your self is made into a future goal",,548
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Lets say that you are a businessperson and after two years of intense stress and strain you finally manage to come out with a product or service that sells well and makes money. Success? In conventional terms, yes. In reality, you spent two years polluting your body as well as the earth with negative energy, made yourself and those around you miserable, and affected many others you never even met. The unconscious assumption behind all such action is that success is a future event, and that the end justifies the means. But the end and the means are one",,557
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Most of their attention is absorbed by thinking, and so they dont really see you, and they are not really listening to you. They are not present in any situation, their attention being either in the past or future which, of course, exist only in the mind as thought forms. Or they relate to you through some kind of role they play and so are not themselves. Most people are alienated from who they are, and some are alienated to such a degree that the way they behave and interact is recognized as phony by almost everyone, except those who are equally phony, equally alienated from who they are",,595
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"Trying to become a good or better human being sounds like a commendable and high-minded thing to do, yet it is an endeavor you cannot ultimately succeed in unless there is a shift in consciousness. This is because it is still part of the same dysfunction, a more subtle and rarified form of self-enhancement, of desire for more and a strengthening of ones conceptual identity, ones self-image. You do not become good by trying to be good, but by finding the goodness that is already within you, and allowing that goodness to emerge. But it can only emerge if something fundamental changes in your state of consciousness",,619
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"How do you let go of attachment to things? Dont even try. Its impossible. Attachment to things drops away by itself when you no longer seek to find yourself in them. In the meantime, just be aware of your attachment to things. Sometimes you may not know that you are attached to something, which is to say, identified, until you lose it or there is the threat of loss. If you then become upset, anxious, and so on, it means you are attached. If you are aware that you are identified with a thing, the identification is no longer total. I am the awareness that is aware that there is attachment. Thats the beginning of the transformation of consciousness",,653
2/21/2022,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,Eckhart Tolle,"You can just as easily identify with a problematic body and make the bodys imperfection, illness, or disability into your identity. You may then think and speak of yourself as a sufferer of this or that chronic illness or disability. You receive a great deal of attention from doctors and others who constantly confirm to you your conceptual identity as a sufferer or a patient. You then unconsciously cling to the illness because it has become the most important part of who you perceive yourself to be. It has become another thought form with which the ego can identify. Once the ego has found an identity, it does not want to let go. Amazingly but not infrequently, the ego in search of a stronger identity can and does create illnesses in order to strengthen itself through them",,782

2/19/2022,Self-Compassion: The Proven Power of Being Kind to Yourself,Kristin Neff,"Self-criticism serves as a submissive behavior because it allows us to abase ourselves before imaginary others who pronounce judgment over us—then reward our submission with a few crumbs from the table.

It was a heavy burden, and no doubt unwelcome, but at least some fun could be got out of it and some pride taken in it.

There are many things I do well and many tasks I accomplish, I could assure myself, so there is no cause for me to admit a loss of control. In other words, I have not wanted to accept that, at times, my life is made unmanageable by my own behaviors.

12/2/2021,In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction,Gabor Mate Md and Peter A. Levine,"Basically, all emotions are modifications of one primordial, undifferentiated emotion that has its origin in the loss of awareness of who you are beyond name and form. Because of its undifferentiated nature, it is hard to find a name that precisely describes this emotion. Fear comes close, but apart from a continuous sense of threat, it also includes a deep sense of abandonment and incompleteness. It may be best to use a term that is as undifferentiated as that basic emotion and simply call it pain.3",,505

This second type of abstinence, while it requires admirable fortitude and patience, can still be experienced in a negative way and contains a hidden danger.

Thats another thing that came to me … all these things that are here … were here before you. And theyre going to be here when Im gone. So Im not bringing nothing new to the table. The only thing new to the table is myself. Im actually the learner.

12/2/2021,In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction,Gabor Mate Md and Peter A. Levine,"And Ive found another, unlooked-for benefit: just as the addiction process permeates every area of your existence, so does sobriety. As you become less attached to your addiction, you also become calmer, less attached to other things that dont matter nearly as much as you used to believe. Your responses are less automatic, less rigid. Not having reason to be so harsh on yourself, you are not so inclined to find fault with others. Things dont always have to go your way for you to be able to enjoy life. And yet more recently, Rae handed the checks back to me with a simple assertion: Its your problem. You deal with it.

12/2/2021,In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts: Close Encounters with Addiction,Gabor Mate Md and Peter A. Levine,What has this addictive urge done for me? you will ask. It has caused me to spend money heedlessly or to stuff myself when I wasnt hungry or to be absent from the ones I love or to expend my energies on activities I later regretted. It has wasted my time. It has led me to lie and to cheat and to pretend—first to myself and then to everyone close to me. It has left me feeling ashamed and isolated. It promised joy and delivered bitterness. Such has been its real value to me; such has been the effect of my allowing some disordered brain circuits to run my life. The real value of my addictive compulsion has been that it has caused me to betray my true values and disregard my true goals,,690

She practiced this way for months and felt held by a tenderness without judgment. Eventually, by the end of the year, she envisioned her cruel parents in Quan Yins lap. One afternoon, as her heart grew easier, she reflected on the neglect and impoverishment of her past and saw that defining herself by her abusive upbringing had begun to dissolve.

Having integrated the Dionysian into a mature personality, the man is able to live fully in the moment, that moment being part of a tapestry, an emotionally rich life that has continuity and commitments",,283
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Aphrodite, Goddess of Love and Beauty, chose Hephaestus for a husband: he did not vie for her and win her or court her. Analogously, a love for beautiful things can just be present in a workingmans psyche, not there as a result of effort or study or even exposure to beautiful things",,283
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Often the relationship has a competitive flavor, and their fun together may be in playing games or doing things that involve skill. Or they may share interests in the arts or music. A work-related relationship can function very well as they challenge and support one another to excel",,283
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Athena women assess situations very well, favoring men who are successful, or will succeed with their help. Jealousy is not a problem for them. Hephaestus men admire and appreciate and even find mysterious how Athena women manage to take care of the finances and alliances that they need to succeed",,298
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"A Dionysus man exists in the present, which is the only reality for him. Consequently, if he descends into the pits and is depressed, it feels unending and eternal to him. This despair can lead to thoughts of suicide as the only way out. Hermes, however, knows that wherever he is, is only temporary",,299
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"An Apollo man usually must grasp the need cognitively before he allows time and space in his life and psyche for Dionysus. He must seek the opportunity to live in the moment, to be absorbed in sensation, feeling, inner imagery, or outer experience. Then it may be possible for Dionysus to be present",,299
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Real love for one another got generated only in these golden periods. Then came the time of separation, as repeatedly happens to men. At every step on the traditional path men are supposed to follow, there is some variation of separating sheep from goats, or boys from men, or achievers from nonachievers",,304
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"The archetype may also predispose a man to have an inner psychological relationship with the Great Mother. Then he feels himself associated with the maternal world, possibly drawn toward expression of maternal instinct via caretaking occupations and domestic interests that are more traditionally feminine",,305
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Women who resemble the goddess of love are drawn to intensity in relationships, which Hephaestus can provide. If he creates beautiful objects or art, her esthetic sensuality is attracted to his work as well. Besides, he sees her as his personal Aphrodite and projects this image on her; she feels like a goddess in his presence",,327
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"In contrast, Dionysus plied him with wine and persuaded Hephaestus to accompany him on a mule. Dionysus did not resort to power, softened Hephaestuss stubborn position, and succeeded where Ares failed. He related to him in his own territory, altering his hard position with alcohol, which made Hephaestus more pliable rather than bellicose",,339
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"W. F. Otto, author of The Homeric Gods, noted that the Greeks saw a kinship between the two: in both they saw a dart speeding to its goal, in one case the unerring arrow, in the other unerring song.2 The song from the most alert of all gods does not arise dreamlike out of an intoxicated soul but flies directly towards a clearly seen truth",,340
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"An Apollo man grows beyond his identification with the archetype that limits him when he makes decisions based on love. He then moves beyond Apollo, whose every decision is made by logic. Now he heads into unknown terrain. However, Apollos ability to discriminate and evaluate, and to take time, can help him distinguish infatuation from love",,342
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"The only way to cultivate this archetype is to take the time to do it. Withdraw from the company of others and let yourself be absorbed in making something with your hands or doing something that is manual, something that you may intuitively know, shifts, expresses, transforms something in you that has been pent up, in the process of the doing",,345
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Dionysus makes love, as he makes music, differently from Apollo. An Apollo man is as goal oriented and technique minded in making love as he is in every other sphere of his life. When he finds how to bring a particular woman to orgasm, his experience becomes a linear progression from one erogenous zone to the other until the goal of orgasm is reached",,352
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Until one is committed, there is hesitancy, the chance to draw back, always ineffectiveness, concerning all acts of initiative (and creation). The moment one definitely commits oneself, then Providence moves too. A whole stream of events issues from the decision. Whatever you can do or dream you can, begin it. Boldness has genius, power and magic in it.2",,356
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"To do this, Neumann says that he must deliberately expose himself to the unconscious and the nonego, which is the darkness, nothingless, the void, the bottomless pit, the underworld, the primordial womb of the Great Mother where the ego can dissolve into the unconscious and be devoured or overcome by irrational fears—the monsters and evils of the unconscious",,360
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"In his music, Apollo was again associated with clarity and purity. In contrast to Dionysian music, which expresses chaos, ecstasy, turbulence, emotional conflicts, and passion, Apollonian music values that clear note, the purity of music that is like higher mathematics, which brings harmony through time and measure and lifts the spirit. Bachs classical music echoes Apollo",,374

He can be wonderfully exciting (when hes playful, hes imaginative and generous, and his happy moods are infectious), or terribly disappointing (when hes promised to do something special with them and doesnt remember, or has lost his previous enthusiasm for something that was to be a shared experience)",,381
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Yet if I wanted to establish contact with that period, I had no choice but to return to it and take up once more that childs life with his childish games. This moment was a turning point in my fate, but I gave in only after endless resistances and with a sense of resignation. For it was a painfully humiliating experience to realize that there was nothing to be done except play childish games",,394
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"The dismemberment motif is especially strong when the Dionysian archetype comes together with religions that emphasize guilt, such as the Judeo-Christian religions, which say If thy left hand offend thee, cut it off. Since mysticism and sensuality are two aspects of Dionysus, a young man may be drawn to Catholic mysticism, for example, yet feel he is a terrible sinner because of his sensual feelings or erotic images",,419
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"There he either sublimates his feelings or expresses them through his work. For example, the architect who longs for a peaceful and orderly home may put these feelings into the house plans he creates (rather than express to his family how strongly he feels about the disorder): The abstract expressionist painter creates on his canvas the atmosphere he longs for, or he may express the anger and pain of feeling that his",,420

She facilitates his entry into the adult world and his pursuit of the Dream. She does this partly through her own actual efforts as teacher, guide, host, critic, sponsor. At a deeper psychological level she enables him to project onto her his own internal feminine figure—the anima, as Jung has depicted it—who generates and supports his heroic strivings",,458
6/24/2021,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Life resembles myth in the Hephaestus-Dionysus friendship department. Often only another intense outsider who makes an effort to know a Hephaestus man, succeeds. Drinking together can be a male-bonding ritual: with Hephaestus, it does not work as a group initiation, but it can work with a another man who appreciates beauty and knows pain, and is not afraid to show his feelings, as a Dionysus man can do. The more extraverted and expressive Dionysus can articulate, emote, or act out what lies hidden inarticulately in Hephaestus. This complementarity provides a common basis for the few deep and lasting friendships that an Hephaestus man may have",,650

5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,We are in danger of falling into one of two extremes: One is to love everyone without loving God; the other is to love God without really loving everyone,,153

When we realize that, the only proper attitude is despair and tremendous anxiety",,267
5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,"If it is true that God is good, then what Jesus said to the rich man is true (Luke 18:22–24); namely, that he had to give up all his riches to enter the kingdom. In this way, he can realize his utter dependence upon the Absolute, that [n]o one is good but God alone (Luke 18:19)",,278

5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,We have to avoid the two extremes: You are bad; there is something wrong with you.

There is no need for you to change or grow. That is the other extreme,,318

I would go to Mass but the whole experience was so empty. The only thing that mattered was Mary. If I did not see her one day, I was miserable; if I would see her, everything was great. If the phone rang and I was told, There is a call for you, I would go just to hear Marys voice",,371
5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,"The world of men has forgotten the joys of silence, the peace of solitude, which is necessary, to some extent, for the fullness of human living. A few lines later Merton adds: Man cannot be happy for long unless he is in contact with the springs of spiritual life which are hidden in the depths of his own soul. If man is exiled constantly from his own home, locked out of his spiritual solitude, he ceases to be a true person",,426
5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,"What I do is this: I gear everything to the experience of God. Everybodys heart is hungry for an experience of God. How to attain this? The answer is threefold. I generally talk about the desire for God. When the desire is very great, one is more likely to attain this experience. Then pray: ask and you will receive. The third method that I suggest for encountering God in Christ is repentance. This is the method that Jesus was always preaching",,446
5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,"If you love truth, be a lover of silence. Silence like the sunlight will illuminate you in God and will deliver you from the phantoms of ignorance.… In the beginning we have to force ourselves to be silent. But then there is born something that draws us to silence.… If only you practice this, untold light will dawn on you in consequence … after a while a certain sweetness is born in the heart of this exercise and the body is drawn almost by force to remain in silence",,471

St. Francis of Assisi imagined taking Christ down from the Cross; he knew that Jesus was no longer on the cross. St. Teresa of Avila consoled Christ in his Agony in the Garden. What were all these people up to? Did they not know that all these things were not literally taking place? Of course they knew! But they understood truth! This is not so much a truth of history, but a truth of mystery. Jesus is no longer an infant, and yet he is! On the rational level, this is hard to explain",,531

In other words, it is the love of comfort and bodily well-being. People will never conquer Mount Everest if they are victims of this love. Sensual love is pampering the senses, a love of satisfying interior and exterior senses. It is pretty similar to carnal love—a flight not only from physical pain, but also from loneliness or emptiness. Finally, worldly love means loving pomp, show, honor, and approval, and avoiding all humiliations",,533
5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,"In time of desolation, Ignatius advises, we should never make any change, but remain firm and constant in the resolution and decision which guided us the day before the desolation, or in the decision to which we adhered in the preceding consolation. For just as in consolation the good spirit guides and counsels us, so in desolation the evil spirit guides and counsels. Following his counsels we can never find the way to a right decision (no. 318). The key idea in this fifth rule is Never change in time of desolation. That is a simple enough rule",,550
5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,"Do not defend; attack! When we are tempted to pray less, we should pray a little more. When we are tempted to eat more, eat a little less. Do not just defend yourself against the enemy. This advice has its value if applied with a certain amount of common sense. If we are tempted after Mass to leave after five minutes, while we had originally planned to stay for ten, we should stay for twelve minutes. What is the advantage of this? It is psychological: We know now that in the future it is useless to be tempted, because we gave ourselves more time",,551
5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,"In order to love others we have to love ourselves. Yet in order to be able to love ourselves, we have to be loved by at least one person. Now, a very few lucky people get this from God. For some peoples psychological well-being this might not be needed. However, if ones spiritual sense is deep and he or she has gone deeper into life, then it is vital. Without it, sooner or later we start to gripe and believe that life is meaningless. It is then that we sense that this emptiness is itself full; that darkness is light. Having this acceptance from God, a person might still be psychologically a neurotic; sometimes, however, this realization overflows into the emotional, and then it is beautiful",,699
5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,"(1) The good spirit does this: first, confusion and humility. Lord I am not worthy. It is thus that all great works begin (for instance, with Moses, Isaiah, Our Lady, Peter, all of them). They are suddenly confronted with the divine and their first response is one of unworthiness: Will I really measure up? I am so inadequate. God consoles them with his power and grace. (2) The next step is the surrender of the heart that is completely disinterested. (3) The third step is charity. One gets to work with great devotedness. (4) And finally: peace in action. To summarize, we start with humility and confusion, we move to surrender of oneself, then on to great devotedness and charity, and then comes peace in action",,717
5/15/2021,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,Anthony De Mello,"Most of the people coming for a retreat have a deep sense of worthlessness; that is, they are full of not-okay feelings. Therefore I stress much more the aspect of how God loves us, as well as the aspect of our sinfulness. And as soon as the retreatants sense Gods love, they want to change. What they need most is the realization of Gods love. Most people come to us wounded today. It is not the sense of sin that they are lacking; it is the sense of lovableness. We have to communicate to people their goodness. A religious sister, for instance, might theoretically see that this is the root of her problem: She cannot praise anyone because she allows no one to praise her; she cannot love because she does not allow anyone to love her; she is giving nothing because she is not receiving anything; and she cannot see others as okay, because she will not see herself as okay. The first thing she must do is see her lovableness",,927

Rejecting the new position of ecclesiastical power, the early monks not only chose a life of ascetic solitude (in fact the word monk comes from the Greek monos, alone), they also decided to live outside the law and the rights that defined social life.

These characters were difficult to translate into French, making written communication nearly impossible for quite some time. Europeans struggled to learn local languages when they took the time to study, but few made any effort to educate themselves on local languages. Instead, early colonizers promoted locals learning the Latin alphabet in place of their local tongues. They argued this would lead to increased equality, as Latin characters were fewer in number.

Fours usually experience this as a longing for an ideal mate or partner. They will often project this role onto new acquaintances, idealizing them and fantasizing about the wonderful life they will have together",,393
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"By overcoming the temptation to withdraw from life to search for themselves, they will not only save themselves from their own destructiveness, they will be able to bring something beautiful and good into existence. If they learn to live this way, Fours can be among the most life-enhancing of the personality types, bringing good out of evil, hope from hopelessness, meaning from absurdity, and saving what appeared to be lost",,427
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"The one that led left toward the A-term leads into the world of ego, with all of the costs we have just described. The other arrow leads up to Level i, and a space marked Self-Actualization. This means that if a person truly wants to achieve his Basic Desire, he must confront his Basic Fear at Level i, but also let go of his Self-image, the definition of himself formed at Level 2, seeing that it is not the whole truth of who they are",,437
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"These represent the psychological capacities and qualities which that type draws on to achieve its Basic Desire and which form the foundation of the persons ego structure. For example, type Twos Basic Fear is of being unwanted, unworthy of being loved. This leads to a compensating Basic Desire, To be loved unconditionally or one could say to be loved for ones self alone. To accomplish this desire Twos become Empathetic, as well as concerned, other-oriented, forgiving, compassionate, and so forth",,500
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"Fours must make a leap of faith that, despite their lack of a clear sense of themselves, they will discover themselves most surely by acting positively toward others. They must love others even if they do not feel that they have been loved adequately. When they love others, Fours will begin to discover who they are, and self-esteem will follow. They will also discover that because they can love, they must have learned to love from somewhere. What they have been given has perhaps been enough after all",,505
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"To establish a self-image, a basic identity that they can rely on, Fours turn not to other people, but to their inner feelings and emotional responses. This provides healthy Fours with intuitive gifts and a rich inner life but also introduces a problem. Of all aspects of the human psyche, feelings are perhaps the most changeable and volatile. By trying to create a consistent identity from the world of feelings, Fours, like all other types, have embarked on a path that cannot provide what they are looking for",,513
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"Self-knowledge became their most important goal, the means by which they hoped to find some self-esteem. Fours felt that if they could discover who they are, they would not feel so different from others in the deep, essential way that they do. However, instead of creating themselves through introspection, Fours ironically become trapped in self-consciousness. Their self-consciousness alienates them, making them feel vulnerable, and arouses their aggressions at themselves and others, particularly their parents",,514
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"In the creative moment, healthy Fours harness their emotions without getting lost in them, not only producing something beautiful but discovering who they are. In the moment of inspiration they are, paradoxically, both most themselves and most liberated from themselves. This is why all forms of creativity are so valued by Fours, and why, in its inspired state, creativity is so hard to sustain. Fours can be inspired only if they have first transcended themselves, something which is extremely threatening to their self-image",,527
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"At Level 2, however, unlike all of the other Levels, the B-term has a different significance. The B-term column at Level 2 represents the persons self-image; thus, the terms here could be called I am terms because they represent the way that the type sees itself. To continue with the example of type Two, at Level 2 under the B-term column we find the words Loving, caring, selfless, thoughtful, warm-hearted, and passionate. These are the I am terms for type Two. People of this type would have little difficulty saying, I am loving, caring, selfless, and so forth",,566
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"To make up for their lack of achievement, Fours at this stage typically give themselves over to sensuality as a way of deadening the too-sensitive self to its growing unhappiness. They may become sexually licentious, engaging in anonymous sexual activities for release, for fleeting human contact, and for excitement. Or they may lose themselves in sexual fantasies, sinking into erotic daydreams rather than making any real efforts at anything. They may masturbate frequently, virtually a symbol for their self-referential, ingrown way of life. They may become obsessed with those with whom they have fallen in love in their imaginations, providing themselves with an endless source of pain and pleasure, desire and frustration, violent and wasteful feelings",,759
10/5/2020,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson,"They become aware of being aware of themselves—their consciousness is filled with little more than fantasies and memories, ultimately leading to illusions, regrets, and a wasted life. As Fours become more fearful that they cannot find a solid identity in themselves, they begin to create one out of whatever random tendencies they find. Thus, matters of taste, likes and dislikes, and emotional reactions become the materials which Fours use to construct an identity. Because their sense of self is so tenuous, however, Fours begin to put a great deal of weight on what would be for others relatively unimportant traits. (I only wear black. I listen to classical music, never country and western.) It is important to note that most of these personal traits function by negation. Fours may not know who they are, but they certainly believe they know who they are not. While these idiosyncrasies can be fairly harmless in and of themselves, as Fours increasingly depend on them to figure out who they are, they begin to paint themselves into a corner. In the interest of maintaining a narrowly defined self-image, Fours may refuse to engage in many basic activities necessary to live their lives. (Im a poet. I cant work in an office.)",,1233

If I tried too hard, thought about it too much, or, conversely, relaxed altogether, the balls fell out of the air. But if I dropped all that and just juggled, it seemed to take care of itself. Juggling and, by implication, meditation required that I suspend my usual orientation and enter some new territory, an intermediate zone that seemed to create something new or evoke something old",,606

The immense might of the infant! His mothers inability to bear the delight it caused her! The verse seemed to support Winnicotts descriptions of the merciless way an infant loves his mother, the way he beats her like a drum with a mix of what we in hindsight would call need, hunger, love, aggression, and entitlement but that in an infant comes all in one package, undifferentiated, like a force of nature",,622

These are not two different capacities – they always go together.

To achieve this a new philosophy will be needed",,415
2/22/2020,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),Bertrand Russell,"It is noteworthy that modern Platonists, with few exceptions, are ignorant of mathematics, in spite of the immense importance that Plato attached to arithmetic and geometry, and the immense influence that they had on his philosophy. This is an example of the evils of specialization: a man must not write on Plato unless he has spent so much of his youth on Greek as to have had no time for the things that Plato thought important",,430
2/22/2020,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),Bertrand Russell,"Unlike religion, it is ethically neutral: it assures men that they can perform wonders, but does not tell them what wonders to perform. In this way it is incomplete. In practice, the purposes to which scientific skill will be devoted depend largely on chance. The men at the head of the vast organizations which it necessitates can, within limits, turn it this way or that as they please. The power impulse thus has a scope which it never had before",,449
2/22/2020,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),Bertrand Russell,"There is, however, a more general argument against reverence, whether for the Greeks or for anyone else. In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held",,474
2/22/2020,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),Bertrand Russell,"But in connection with mathematics the one-sidedness of the Greek genius appears: it reasoned deductively from what appeared self-evident, not inductively from what had been observed. Its amazing successes in the employment of this method misled not only the ancient world, but the greater part of the modern world also. It has only been very slowly that scientific method, which seeks to reach principles inductively from observations of particular facts, has replaced the Hellenic belief in deduction from luminous axioms derived from the mind of the philosopher",,564
2/22/2020,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),Bertrand Russell,"During the period of ecclesiastical domination, from the fifth century to the fifteenth, there was a certain conflict between what was theoretically believed and, what was actually felt. Theoretically, the world was a vale of tears, a preparation, amid tribulation, for the world to come. But in practice the writers of books, being almost all clerics, could not help feeling exhilarated by the power of the Church; they found opportunity for abundant activity of a sort that they believed to be useful. They had therefore the mentality of a governing class, not of men who feel themselves exiles in an alien world. This is part of the curious dualism that runs through the Middle Ages, owing to the fact that the Church, though based on other-worldly beliefs, was the most important institution in the every-day world",,818
2/22/2020,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),Bertrand Russell,"By self-interest Man has become gregarious, but in instinct he has remained to a great extent solitary; hence the need of religion and morality to reinforce self-interest. But the habit of forgoing present satisfactions for the sake of future advantages is irksome, and when passions are roused the prudent restraints of social behaviour become difficult to endure. Those who, at such times, throw them off, acquire a new energy and sense of power from the cessation of inner conflict, and, though they may come to disaster in the end, enjoy meanwhile a sense of godlike exaltation which, though known to the great mystics, can never be experienced by a merely pedestrian virtue. The solitary part of their nature reasserts itself, but if the intellect survives the reassertion must clothe itself in myth.

2/22/2020,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),Bertrand Russell,"I think perhaps the strongest argument on Hume's side is to be derived from the character of causal laws in physics. It appears that simple rules of the form A causes B are never to be admitted in science, except as crude suggestions in early stages. The causal laws by which such simple rules are replaced in well-developed sciences are so complex that no one can suppose them given in perception; they are all, obviously, elaborate inferences from the observed course of nature. I am leaving out of account modern quantum theory, which reinforces the above conclusion. So far as the physical sciences are concerned, Hume is wholly in the right; such propositions as A causes B are never to be accepted, and our inclination to accept them is to be explained by the laws of habit and association. These laws themselves, in their accurate form, will be elaborate statements as to nervous tissue—primarily its physiology, then its chemistry, and ultimately its physics",,966
2/22/2020,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),Bertrand Russell,"A difficulty arises from Hume's contention that there is no such thing as an impression of a causal relation. We can perceive, by mere observation of A and B, that A is above B, or to the right of B, but not that A causes B. In the past, the relation of causation had been more or less assimilated to that of ground and consequent in logic, but this, Hume rightly perceived, was a mistake. In the Cartesian philosophy, as in that of the Scholastics, the connection of cause and effect was supposed to be necessary, as logical connections are necessary. The first really serious challenge to this view came from Hume, with whom the modern philosophy of causation begins. He, in common with almost all philosophers down to and including Bergson, supposes the law to state that there are propositions of the form A causes B, where A and B are classes of events; the fact that such laws do not occur in any well-developed science appears to be unknown to philosophers. But much of what they have said can be translated so as to be applicable to causal laws such as do occur; we may, therefore, ignore this point for the present. Hume begins by observing that the power by which one subject produces another is not discoverable from the ideas of the two objects, and that we can therefore only know cause and effect from experience, not from reasoning or reflection. The statement what begins must have a cause, he says, is not one that has intuitive certainty, like the statements of logic. As he puts it: There is no object, which implies the existence of any other if we consider these objects in themselves, and never look beyond the ideas which we form of them. Hume argues from this that it must be experience that gives knowledge of cause and effect, but that it cannot be merely the experience of the two events A and B which are in a causal relation to each other. It must be experience, because the connection is not logical; and it cannot be merely the experience of the particular events A and B, since we can discover nothing in A by itself which should lead to produce B. The experience required, he says, is that of the constant conjunction of events of the kind A with events of the kind B. He points out that when, in experience, two objects are constantly conjoined, we do in fact infer one from the other. (When he says infer, he means that perceiving the one makes us expect the other; he does not mean a formal or explicit inference.) Perhaps, the necessary connection depends on the inference, not vice versa. That is to say, the sight of A causes the expectation of B, and so leads us to believe that there is a necessary connection between A and B. The inference is not determined by reason, since that would require us to assume the uniformity of nature, which itself is not necessary, but only inferred from experience",,2839

Only people-lovers are not controlled by other people",,236
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"Fear in the biblical sense is a much broader word. It includes being afraid of someone, but it extends to holding someone in awe, being controlled or mastered by people, worshipping other people, putting your trust in people, or needing people",,243
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"Individualism, at first, only saps the virtues of public life; but, in the long run, it attacks and destroys all others, and is at length absorbed in downright selfishness. Selfishness is a vice as old as the world... individualism is of democratic origin",,255
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"Therefore, a Christian father who takes time to play soccer with his children is imaging the God who spends time with his people. A child who sets the table or cleans the dinner dishes out of obedience to Christ is imaging the servant God and thus glorifying him",,262
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"ways to raise your self-esteem is to achieve some successes (which are then compared to what others do) or to surround yourself with people who affirm you (which leaves you dependent on their opinion). If you have money, your self-esteem can be inflated by a warm, empathic therapist",,283
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"The problem is that we really are not okay. There is no reason why we should feel great about ourselves. We truly are deficient. The meager props of the self-esteem teaching will eventually collapse as people realize that their problem is much deeper. The problem is, in part, our nakedness before God",,301
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"he delighted in demonstrating his awesome forgiveness to Peter. Tell his disciples and Peter, the angel announced after the resurrection. Then, perhaps on another cool night around a fire, Jesus countered Peters three denials with three invitations to feed the flock, and he finished by saying, Follow me",,304
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"My reasoning, certainly not original with me, was that I didnt have to measure up to the standards of others opinions because Gods opinion of me was rooted in the finished work of Jesus. In other words, even though I was a sinner, God loved me and made me righteous in his sight, so who cared what other people thought?!",,320
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"But for many people, the desire for these things has roots in something that is far from Gods design for his image-bearers. Unless you understand the biblical parameters of marital commitment, your spouse will become the one you fear. Your spouse will control you. Your spouse will quietly take the place of God in your life",,324
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"Self-consciousness, being controlled by the opinions of others, or whatever it was called, could only be managed, not cured. Perhaps future success would help. Or (and I thought this was quite clever) I could embellish one of the justifications that had crossed my mind earlier in the day. I could do well but never be wholeheartedly devoted to any particular task",,364
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"We want to hide, but we also want to spy. Spying might reveal the vulnerability of others so that we can believe that they are no different from us (or even not as good as us). Disgrace wants company. On the other hand, it might reveal someone who is strong and can be our hero. With a hero, we might feel less isolated because we can enter into a safe fantasy relationship",,373
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"How could he have denied the Lord? He had seen the miracles. He was given the Spirit who revealed to him that Jesus was the Christ. He was the rock. He witnessed the transfiguration! He loved Jesus. Denial was unthinkable. But he too was like us — a fellow sinner, spiritually inept apart from the constant work of the Holy Spirit. He too could exalt people so that they seemed bigger than Jesus himself",,403
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"However, if making a decision for Jesus means that we might spend years being unpopular, ignored, poor, or criticized, then there are masses of Christians who temporarily put their faith on the shelf. Death is not imminent, so why hurry into such a rash decision? There will be time later to get things straight with God. In other words, kill me, but dont keep me from being liked, appreciated, or respected",,407
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,Arent the most popular mission trips the ones that take us far from our own neighborhood? Russia is easy; our own neighborhood is a constant challenge. Has anyone consistently had the boldness and clarity of Jesus in testifying about the gospel? Never. Has anyone consistently avoided the fear of man in evangelism? Certainly not. There is a foolishness inherent in the message of the cross. The clear proclamation of the gospel does not make us look good. It doesnt make us popular,,482
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"Thats the paradox of self-esteem: Low self-esteem usually means that I think too highly of myself. Im too self-involved, I feel I deserve better than what I have. The reason I feel bad about myself is that I aspire to something more. I want just a few minutes of greatness. I am a peasant who wants to be king. When you are in the grips of low self-esteem, its painful, and it certainly doesnt feel like pride. But I believe that this is the dark, quieter side of pride — thwarted pride",,486
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"We concentrate on actions and overlook attitudes. By doing this, our sinful nature can give us a sense that we are okay. We have not killed today. We have not been adulterous. We have not stolen anything from the store. Therefore, we had a good day. Better yet, we are good. Of course, we occasionally do bad things. We might yell too loudly, or we might pick up some pornography at the airport. In these cases we should ask Gods forgiveness. But, on the whole, we tend to be fairly good. And if we think we are usually good, then God is usually irrelevant",,556
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"Marriage has been a privilege and blessing to me. It has also been the context for a surprising discovery. I found that being okay in Christ was not quite enough for me. When I was first married, I knew that Jesus loved me, but I also wanted my new wife to be absolutely, forever smitten with me. I needed love from her. I could finally handle small amounts of rejection from other people, but I felt paralyzed if I didnt have the love I needed from her. I needed unconditional love. If she didnt think I was a great husband, I would be crushed (and, as you might guess, a little angry)",,586
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"Significant cultural changes started in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Before this, people believed that there was a preordained, divine structure to the world. Everybody and everything had its place. If you were born into a certain class, family, or trade, your life was mapped out for you. I am an Englishman, I am a member of St. Annes parish, I am a farmer, and I am the second son of Charles. Such was your identity. There was no need for vocational and religious decisions; they had already been made for you. There were few identity crises when everyone knew who and what they were supposed to be",,604
8/27/2019,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Edward T. Welch,"Sometimes I would think, Is it really Christ that I am standing on, or am I standing on my perceived successes and the favorable opinions of others? After all, other people were usually very affirming. Maybe I felt good about myself because they felt good about me. Or maybe I felt good about myself because I had done respectably in athletics and had decent grades, compared to other people. Maybe I had taken pride in my ministry aspirations, compared to other people and their seemingly lower spiritual goals. Maybe I found an identity in being nice, or at least nicer than most of the people I knew. But arent all people-pleasers nice? In short, perhaps I was still being ruled by the opinions of others, but since I was feeling fine, I wasnt very motivated to investigate",,776

8/12/2019,Kafka on the Shore (Vintage International),Haruki Murakami,"What Chekhov was getting at is this: necessity is an independent concept. It has a different structure from logic, morals, or meaning. Its function lies entirely in the role it plays. What doesnt play a role shouldnt exist. What necessity requires does need to exist. Thats what you call dramaturgy. Logic, morals, or meaning dont have anything to do with it. Its all a question of relationality. Chekhov understood dramaturgy very well",,436

Why did one know so little? Why could one not speak with this flower? But then, even human beings were hardly able to speak to each other. Even there one had to be lucky, find a special friendship, a readiness. No, it was fortunate that love did not need words; or else it would be full of misunderstanding and foolishness",,613

Over the long run, whatever difficulties we have in our other relationships will probably arise as well with our teacher, from issues of trust—trusting too easily or being unable to trust—to issues of boundaries, fear, doubt, and need",,611

I had used the strength of my mind in meditation to suppress painful feelings, and all too often I didnt even recognize that I was angry, sad, grieving, or frustrated until a long time later. The roots of my unhappiness in relationships had not been examined. I had very few skills for dealing with my feelings or for engaging on an emotional level or for living wisely with my friends and loved ones",,625

Thats why they instinctively dislike history, nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it, and they explain it all as stupidity! Thats why they so dislike the living process of life; they dont want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul wont obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of india-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and wont revolt!",,1216

1/13/2019,A Primer for Choreographers,Lois Ellfeldt,"There is one final comment to be made about these sugges­tions for action. The dancer's first impulse is often to mimic or be the thing suggested. This is a characteristic response of children, who have a wonderful belief in their ability, as the song says, to Be a tree, be a sled, be a purple spool of thread. This method often insures a magical sincerity of action that mature artists strive to recapture. But an artist's response should be more creative.

1/13/2019,Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance Into Jerusalem To The Resurrection,Pope Benedict XVI,"Rudolf Bultmann raised an objection against Resurrection faith by arguing that even if Jesus had come back from the grave, we would have to say that a miraculous natural event such as the resuscitation of a dead man would not help us and would be existentially irrelevant (cf. New Testament and Mythology, p. 7)",,311
1/13/2019,Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance Into Jerusalem To The Resurrection,Pope Benedict XVI,"So two qualifications are important. On the one hand, Jesus has not returned to the empirical existence that is subject to the law of death, but he lives anew in fellowship with God, permanently beyond the reach of death. On the other hand, it is important that the encounters with the risen Lord are not just interior events or mystical experiences—they are real encounters with the living one who is now embodied in a new way and remains embodied. Luke emphasizes this very strongly: Jesus is not, as the disciples initially feared, a ghost or a spirit:",,555
1/13/2019,Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance Into Jerusalem To The Resurrection,Pope Benedict XVI,"Now it must be acknowledged that if in Jesus Resurrection we were dealing simply with the miracle of a resuscitated corpse, it would ultimately be of no concern to us. For it would be no more important than the resuscitation of a clinically dead person through the art of doctors. For the world as such and for our human existence, nothing would have changed. The miracle of a resuscitated corpse would indicate that Jesus Resurrection was equivalent to the raising of the son of the widow of Nain (Lk 7:11-17), the daughter of Jairus (Mk 5:22-24, 35-43 and parallel passages), and Lazarus (Jn 11:1-44). After a more or less short period, these individuals returned to their former lives, and then at a later point they died definitively",,737
1/13/2019,Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance Into Jerusalem To The Resurrection,Pope Benedict XVI,"he has flesh and bones (Lk 24:36-43). What a ghost is, what is meant by the apparition of a spirit as opposed to the apparition of the risen Lord, can best be seen in the biblical account of the medium at Endor, who at Sauls behest conjures up the spirit of Samuel from the underworld (cf. 1 Sam 28:7-19). The spirit that she calls forth is a dead man dwelling among the shadows in the underworld, who from time to time can be summoned forth, only to return to the realm of the dead. Jesus, however, does not come from the realm of the dead, which he has definitively left behind: on the contrary, he comes from the realm of pure life, from God; he comes as the one who is truly alive, who is himself the source of life. Luke underlines quite dramatically how different the risen Lord is from a mere spirit by recounting that Jesus asked the still fearful disciples for something to eat and then ate a piece of grilled fish before their eyes",,941

In the free emptiness of the breeze that blows from where it pleases and goes where no one can estimate, God and man are together, not speaking in words, or syllables or forms. And that was the meaning of creation and of Paradise. But there was more. The Word of God Himself was the firstborn of every creature.

The more we persist in misunderstanding the phenomena of life, the more we analyze them out into strange finalities and complex purposes of our own, the more we involve ourselves in sadness, absurdity and despair. But it does not matter much, because no despair of ours can alter the reality of things, or stain the joy of the cosmic dance which is always there. Indeed, we are in the midst of it, and it is in the midst of us, for it beats in our very blood, whether we want it to or not. Yet the fact remains that we are invited to forget ourselves on purpose, cast our awful solemnity to the winds and join in the general dance",,753

11/22/2018,Business for the Glory of God: The Bible&#39;s Teaching on the Moral Goodness of Business,Wayne Grudem,"In any society, some people are too cautious by nature to assume the risks involved in starting and running a business, but others are willing to take that risk, and it is right to give them some profit as a reward for taking those risks that benefit all the rest of us. It is the hope of such reward that motivates people to start businesses and assume such risks. If profit were not allowed in a society, then people would not take such risks, and we would have very few goods available to buy. Allowing profit, therefore, is a very good thing that brings benefits to everybody in the society",,594

11/13/2018,The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development,Donald G. Reinertsen,"Most product developers do not understand the statistics of granular schedules. A granular timeline subdivides time intervals into very small buckets. When we do this, the coefficient of variation for each of these buckets becomes very high. This makes variance very high and conformance unlikely. Even worse, if we incentivize conformance, people will insert contingency reserves to prevent their tasks from missing the schedule. The more granular the schedule, the larger the schedule reserves. And these reserves aggregate into even longer timelines. The more we increase planning detail and the harder we try to incentivize performance, the worse our problem becomes",,670

Symbolist performance was done in small theatres. It was detached, distant, and static, involving little physical energy. The lighting was often dim. The actors often worked behind scrims … The art was self-contained, isolated, complete in itself. We can call this the hermetic model of avant-garde performance.21",,568

So just as in the case of physical objects and living organisms, they should possess a certain magnitude, and this should be such that it can readily be taken in at one view [eusynopton], so in the case of plots: they should have a certain length, and this should be such that it can readily be held in memory.21",,699
4/20/2018,Postdramatic Theatre,Hans-Thies Lehmann,"The destruction of theatre time into ever more tiny pieces is thus influenced by the new fast pace. Later, postdramatic theatre will carry this demolition of the continuum into the staging of classical drama, as well. While, on the one hand, dramatic rhythm dissolves into stasis and later into durational aesthetics, on the other, theatre accelerates the rhythm to such an extent that drama falls apart, too. In many productions of the 1980s and 1990s the dismemberment of actions and time into individual numbers is very pronounced. The dialectic connection of the two time distortions – duration and acceleration – becomes apparent as soon as one focuses on the development of the peculiar time aesthetics of post-dramatic theatre.37",,736
4/20/2018,Postdramatic Theatre,Hans-Thies Lehmann,"in Hegels understanding, the experience of fate forms the kernel of the drama. This, however, is an ethical experience: something eludes the control of ethical volition, throwing a contingency into the dramatic play – and thereby into the play of the Spirit. This is fatal for the ethical concept. This contingency or plurality, appearing in the divine as much as among humans, destroys any possibility of ultimate reconciliation. What marks the dramatic is a rupture that it tries to mend scantily in order to maintain the truth of reconciliation through a stylization that empties the drama of material reality.

The stringent differentiation between music and Musica, and their relative evaluation, were easily translatable from Platonist into Christian terms and remained standard in music treatises until the fourteenth century and even beyond",,523

The theme is not so much presented as it is achieved—achieved through struggle. The clarity of metaphor here, instantly apprehended by contemporary listeners, lent this music from the beginning an unprecedented ethical potency",,527

P. E. Bach, who as we know had a formative influence on Haydns style. The Sturm und Drang movement also led, or fed, into the main stream of Romanticism that would soon engulf European art, and for the first time put German artists at the forefront of European culture",,584

The same rhetorical gesture that governed the very first statement of the fanfare—that of a disruptive detour enabling a triumphant return—will shape the movement as a whole, lending the opening statement a quality of prophesy and the whole a quality of fated consequence",,627

The employers needs—whether measured in idealized terms of artistic satisfaction or in crasser terms of blue-blood exhibitionism (Prachtlieb or quantitative luxury)—were met. And the employee was liberated by his very exploitation, as it were, to develop his skills freely, knowing that the products of their free exercise would translate, from the employers standpoint, into uniquely distinguished and valuable possessions",,658

Like the later doctrine of affections, the stile rappresentativo was at the opposite pole from romantic notions of untrammeled musical expressivity. For one thing, it depended on alliance with words—another art. For another, it expressed not the unique feelings of the composer but the archetypical feelings of characters, and hence emphasized general human nature as an object of representation, not the uniqueness of an individual self as an object of expression. For a third, it dealt with particular objectified categories of feeling that had names, that could be (and were) classified and catalogued, that were the common property of humanity. It was powerless to summon up the verbally inexpressible, the ineffable, the metaphysical or infinite. Hence, it could communicate only through a repeatable process of objective intellectual cognition (or recognition), not transcendent subjective inspiration. It was not an absolute art, let alone an autonomous or emancipated one. It dealt in the common coin of shared humanity, not the elite currency of genius",,1241

10/9/2017,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),Philip Shaw,"in art the spiritual and material spheres are intertwined: the spiritual emerges when we become aware of the material inertia, the dysfunctional bare presence, of the objects around us'",,185
10/9/2017,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),Philip Shaw,"Postmodernism therefore avoids not only the Romantic belief in the ability of art to synthesize noumena and phenomena, but also the modernist attitude of mourning for the loss of this belief",,190
10/9/2017,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),Philip Shaw,"David proclaims that divine knowledge 'is too wonderful' to express; 'it is high, I cannot attain it' (line 6; Holy Bible 2001). Yet somehow a sense of God's majesty is conveyed through this very failure",,203
10/9/2017,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),Philip Shaw,"Postmodernism, as Lyotard sees it, is not a deviation from but rather a radicalisation of Kant's original 'Analytic'; it aims to maintain the shock of the sublime so as to prevent the ascendancy of the rational over the real",,224
10/9/2017,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),Philip Shaw,"Sublimity, then, refers to the moment when the ability to apprehend, to know, and to express a thought or sensation is defeated. Yet through this very defeat, the mind gets a feeling for that which lies beyond thought and language",,230
10/9/2017,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),Philip Shaw,"Thus, as the critic Thomas Weiskel has claimed, even as the sublime continues to bear on our imaginative life, we no longer share in the sacred or mystical aspects of the sublime, which went unquestioned by previous generations (1976:36)",,237
10/9/2017,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),Philip Shaw,"In painting, for example, the ultimate mode of expression will be pure abstraction: 'it will be white', Lyotard states, 'like one of Malevitch's squares; it will enable us to see only by making it impossible to see; it will please only by causing pain'",,252
10/9/2017,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),Philip Shaw,"The postmodern sublime, one might say, is defined not by its intimations of transcendence but rather by its confirmation of immanence, the sense in which the highest of the high is nothing more than an illusion brought about through our misperception of reality",,261
10/9/2017,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),Philip Shaw,"As such, the sublime marks the limits of reason and expression together with a sense of what might lie beyond these limits; this may well explain its association with the transcendent, conceived by the theologian John Milbank 'as the absolutely unknowable void, upon whose brink we finite beings must dizzily hover'",,315

9/16/2017,Goddesses in Everywoman:: Powerful Archetypes in Women&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"Men for whom an Artemis is my kind of woman are often attracted to her as a twin or kindred spirit—a female counterpart of themselves. Or they may be attracted to her independent, assertive, spirit and strength of will, which may be undeveloped in themselves. Or they may be drawn to her as an image of purity that corresponds to an ideal in themselves",,352
9/16/2017,Goddesses in Everywoman:: Powerful Archetypes in Women&#39;s Lives,Jean Shinoda Bolen M.D.,"As long as there is an element of pursuit on her part, an Artemis woman may be interested in a man. But if he moves closer emotionally, wants to marry her, or becomes dependent on her, the excitement of the hunt is over. Moreover, she may lose interest or feel contempt for him if he shows weakness by needing her. As a result, an Artemis woman may have a series of relationships that go well only as long as the man keeps some emotional distance and is not always available. This pattern can arise if a woman identifies with the one-in-herself virgin goddess element and denies her own vulnerability and need for another. To change, she must discover that the love and trust of another special person is very precious to her",,725

Sadler,"Two great divisions of colour occur to the mind at the outset: into warm and cold, and into light and dark. To each colour there are therefore four shades of appeal–warm and light or warm and dark, or cold and light or cold and dark. Generally speaking, warmth or cold in a colour means an approach respectively to yellow or to blue",,332

4/20/2017,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)",Wassily Kandinsky and M. T. H. Sadler,"In nearly all these works the symphonic composition is not very closely allied to the melodic. This means that fundamentally there is a composition founded on rest and balance. The mind thinks at once of choral compositions, of Mozart and Beethoven. All these works have the solemn and regular architecture of a Gothic cathedral; they belong to the transition period. As examples of the new symphonic composition, in which the melodic element plays a subordinate part, and that only rarely, I have added reproductions of four of my own pictures",,544
4/20/2017,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)",Wassily Kandinsky and M. T. H. Sadler,"(1) A direct impression of outward nature, expressed in purely artistic form. This I call an Impression. (2) A largely unconscious, spontaneous expression of inner character, the non-material nature. This I call an Improvisation. (3) An expression of a slowly formed inner feeling, which comes to utterance only after long maturing. This I call a Composition. In this, reason, consciousness, purpose, play an overwhelming part. But of the calculation nothing appears, only the feeling. Which kind of construction, whether conscious or unconscious, really underlies my work, the patient reader will readily understand",,616
4/20/2017,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)",Wassily Kandinsky and M. T. H. Sadler,"If, in considering an example of melodic composition, one forgets the material aspect and probes down into the artistic reason of the whole, one finds primitive geometrical forms or an arrangement of simple lines which help toward a common motion. This common motion is echoed by various sections and may be varied by a single line or form. Such isolated variations serve different purposes. For instance, they may act as a sudden check, or to use a musical term, a fermata.72 Each form which goes to make up the composition has a simple inner value, which has in its turn a melody. For this reason I call the composition melodic",,629

11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"A philosophical analysis will help us avoid the temptation to turn moments into pieces, as we might do, for example, when we attempt to separate vision from mobility",,165
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"We can evidence the way things are; when we do so, we discover objects, but we also discover ourselves, precisely as datives of disclosure, as those to whom things appear",,170

11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"of presence and absence, of filled and empty intentions, that we have not yet examined. It is the fact that both the empty and the filled intending are directed toward one and the same object",,191
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,But the mind cannot be separated out in this way; the mind is a moment to the world and the things in it; the mind is essentially correlated with its objects. The mind is essentially intentional,,194

11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"If the identity presents itself now in one way, it also holds in reserve other ways of being given and of reappearing as the same thing again, to ourselves and to others; it always both reveals and conceals itself",,213
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,Wholes can be analyzed into two different kinds of parts: pieces and moments. Pieces are parts that can subsist and be presented even apart from the whole; they can be detached from their wholes. Pieces can also be called independent parts,,239
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,Many issues that seem very complicated turn out to be simple when formulated in terms of the kinds of parts that function within them. A philosophical analysis usually consists in laying out the various moments that go to make up a given whole,,243
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"Thus, when we want to explain how we can speak about objects that are not present, we tend to say that we are dealing with an image or a concept of the object, which is present, and through that image or concept we reach toward the absent thing",,244
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"What often happens in philosophy is that something that is a moment is taken to be a piece, taken to be separable from its wider whole and other parts; then an artificial philosophical problem arises about how the original whole can be reconstituted",,249
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"About a third of the way through the book, in chapter 6, Beckett interrupts his narrative to undertake a justification of the expression, Murphys mind. He says he will not try to describe this apparatus as it really was, but only what it felt and pictured itself to be",,268
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"Marx, for example, elevates economics to the whole of social relationships, and Hobbes elevates contractual relations, which are only a part of the social whole, into being the whole. The working out of parts and wholes is central to philosophy and human understanding",,268
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"What we try to do in our philosophical analysis is to secure the reality of such identities, to bring out the fact that they are different from their manifolds of presentation, and to show that despite their slippery status they truly are a component of what we experience",,272
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"phenomenology, in its classical form, insists that parts are only understood against the background of appropriate wholes, that manifolds of appearance harbor identities, and that absences make no sense except as played off against the presences that can be achieved through them",,279
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"We do argue with one another about what ought to be done and about what the facts are, but philosophically and culturally we find it difficult to ratify our naive acceptance of a common world and our ability to discover and communicate what it is. The denial of intentionality has as its correlate the denial of the minds orientation toward truth",,346
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"There are different kinds of intending, correlated with different kinds of objects. For example, we carry out perceptual intentions when we see an ordinary material object, but we must intend pictorially when we see a photograph or a painting. We must change our intentionality; taking something as a picture is different from taking something as a simple object",,362
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"It strives to account for concepts and thoughts as being more public than they are often taken to be. It tries to show that senses and propositions are not psychological, mental, or conceptual entities. To understand propositions and senses in the right way is a crucial matter in discussing the nature of truth, especially in the philosophical climate generated by modern philosophy",,383
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"Another kind of reductionism, a more sophisticated kind, is the psychological; it is called psychologism. From its beginning in the early twentieth century, phenomenology attacked the psychologistic interpretation of truth, reason, and the ego; psychologism was the foil against which phenomenology originally defined itself. Nevertheless, paradoxically enough, many people mistakenly regard phenomenology itself as a form of psychologism",,438
11/11/2016,Introduction to Phenomenology,Robert Sokolowski,"But once we admit that there are such things as profiles distinguished from aspects, and aspects distinguished from sides, we find that it is quite impossible to account for such structures in terms of simple impressions and ideas within the mind. If everything were simply internal to us, all we would have given to us would be profiles: flashes of color and bits of sound, out of which objects would have to be constructed. We could never distinguish among a profile and an aspect and a side",,493

We see that the other person, like us, has both flowers and garbage inside, and we accept this. Our practice is to water the flower in our loved one, and not bring them more garbage. When we try to grow flowers, if they dont grow well, we dont blame them or argue with them. Our partner is a flower. If we take care of her well, she will grow beautifully. If we take care of her poorly, she will wither. To help a flower grow well, we must understand her nature. How much water and sunshine does she need?",,609

We want to be the object of another persons attention and contemplation. We want someone who will look at us and embrace our feeling of emptiness and suffering with his energy of mindfulness. Soon we become addicted to that kind of energy; we think that without that attention, we cant live. It helps us feel less empty and helps us forget the block of suffering inside. When we ourselves cant generate the energy to take care of ourselves, we think we need the energy of someone else. We focus on the need and the lack rather than generating the energy of mindfulness, concentration, and insight that can heal our suffering and help the other person as well",,750

If you look for the self of a flower, you will see that it is empty. But when Buddhists began worshiping the idea of emptiness, he said, It is worse if you get caught in the non-self of a flower than if you believe in the self of a flower. The Buddha did not present an absolute doctrine. His teaching of non-self was offered in the context of his time. It was an instrument for meditation. But many Buddhists since then have gotten caught by the idea of non-self. They confuse the means and the end, the raft and the shore, the finger pointing to the moon and the moon. There is something more important than non-self. It is the freedom from the notions of both self and non-self. For a Buddhist to be attached to any doctrine, even a Buddhist one, is to betray the Buddha",,832

5/4/2016,The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century (PICADOR),Alex Ross,Alban invented an excuse to keep his poetic passion within those boundaries which he himself desired.

5/4/2016,The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century (PICADOR),Alex Ross,"Now there is no taboo; everything is allowed. But one cannot simply go back to tonality, its not the way.

5/4/2016,The Rest Is Noise: Listening to the Twentieth Century (PICADOR),Alex Ross,"Coincidentally or not, a similar transformation is said to happen in Adrian Leverkühns Apocalipsis cum figuris, where a choral passage moves through all the shades of graduated whispering, antiphonal speech, and quasi-chant on up to the most polyphonic song—accompanied by songs that begin as simple noise, as magical, fanatical African drums and booming gongs, only to attain the highest music",,394

4/29/2016,Gertrude,Hermann Hesse and Thomas Fasano and and Adele Lewisohn,"I suddenly realized how falsely and pitifully I had lived this whole time—that now, love, friends, customs and the joys of these years, fell from me like ill-fitting clothes, without causing me any grief. I only wondered how I had clung to them so long, or they to me",,267
4/29/2016,Gertrude,Hermann Hesse and Thomas Fasano and and Adele Lewisohn,"So this time for which I had watched and from which I had expected so much, was the only time in my life when I went my joyless way, forsaken by the spirit of music. And therein, I lived days without tone and without rhythm. Where I had sought enjoyment and inspiration, glory and beauty, I found only rules and obligations, difficulties and dangers. When any music did come, either it was something banal—done a hundred times before—or it contradicted all the rules of harmony, and so was worth nothing. I packed away all my great thoughts and hopes. I was one of the thousands who approach art with youthful audacity, and whose strength fails when it becomes serious",,668
4/29/2016,Gertrude,Hermann Hesse and Thomas Fasano and and Adele Lewisohn,"I was a patient, not exactly lazy, but not a good student, and in my last year I made very little effort. For that, neither indolence nor my love affair was to blame. Rather an indifference, an absorption in the dreams of youth, a dullness of mind and of sense, which only now and then was suddenly and sharply interrupted, when one of the wonderful, premature hours of creative desire enveloped me as with ether. Then I felt myself enclosed by a clear, crystal air, in which no dreams were possible; in which all my senses were sharpened, and on the lookout. What resulted of those hours was little—perhaps ten melodies and a few beginnings of harmonic sketches. But their atmosphere I can never forget—that clear, almost cold air, and that intense concentration of my thoughts to give to a melody the perfect rhythm and not an accidental movement and resolution. I was not pleased with these little accomplishments. I never considered them logical and good, but it was clear to me that in my life there would be nothing so much desired, nothing so important, as the return of such hours of vision and of creation",,1114

4/27/2016,The Courage to Create,Rollo May,"Commitment is healthiest when it is not without doubt, but in spite of doubt.

4/27/2016,The Courage to Create,Rollo May,"Hence the tension that is involved in creative activity. If we are too rigid, dogmatic, or bound to previous conclusions, we will, of course, never let this new element come into our consciousness; we will never let ourselves be aware of the knowledge that exists on another level within us. But the insight often cannot be born until the conscious tension, the conscious application, is relaxed",,395
4/27/2016,The Courage to Create,Rollo May,"All artists have at some time had the experience at the end of the day of feeling tired, spent, and so certain they can never express their vision that they vow to forget it and start all over again on something else the next morning. But during the night their liver grows back again. They arise full of energy and go back with renewed hope to their task, again to strive in the smithy of their soul",,400
4/27/2016,The Courage to Create,Rollo May,"Then I began to notice the presence of triangles in this persons dreams. First, in her dreams referring to her infantile period, it was the triangle of father, mother, and baby. In what I took to be her adolescent phase, the triangle was composed of two women and a man, and she, as one of the women, moved in space toward the man. Then after some months of analysis, in a Lesbian phase, the triangle consisted of two women and a man with the two women standing together. In a still later period the triangles turned into rectangles: two men were in the dream with two women, assumedly her boy friend, herself, her mother, and her father. Her development then became a process of working through rectangles to form eventually a new triangle, her man, herself, and a child. These dreams occurred in the middle and later parts of the analysis. That the symbol of the triangle is fundamental",,888

Two 24-year-olds, who had never made a successful game, with all of their worldly possessions in the back of their car, were going to drive to Los Angeles, hire their first employees, figure out what made a great action game, work on their first 3D title ever, and create a compelling character and franchise.

3/18/2016,On Moral Fiction,John Gardner,Art is as original and important as it is precisely because it does not start out with clear knowledge of what it means to say,,126
3/18/2016,On Moral Fiction,John Gardner,"As a general rule, the artist who begins with a doctrine to promulgate, instead of a rabble multitude of ideas and emotions, is beaten before he starts. True art imitates natures total process: endless blind experiment (fish that climb trees, hands with nine fingers, shifts in and out of tonality) and then ruthless selectivity—the artists sober judgments, like a lions, of what can be killed, what is better left alone, such as (for the lion) rhinos and certain nasty snakes. Art, in sworn opposition to chaos, discovers by its process what it can say. That is arts morality. Its full meaning is beyond paraphrase, though critical paraphrase may make difficult things easier, even to the artist himself",,704
3/18/2016,On Moral Fiction,John Gardner,"By its nature, criticism makes art sound more intellectual than it is—more calculated and systematic. Analytic intelligence is not intelligence of the kind that leads us through imitated concrete experience to profound intellectual and emotional understanding, but a cooler, more abstract kind that isolates complicated patterns and notes the subtleties or wider implications of what the artist has said. The best critical intelligence, capable of making connections the artist himself may be blind to, is a noble thing in its place; but applied to the making of art, cool intellect is likely to produce superficial work, either art which is all sensation or art which is all thought. We see this wherever we find art too obviously constructed to fit a theory, as in the music of John Cage or in the recent fiction of William Gass. The elaboration of texture for its own sake is as much an intellectual, even academic exercise as is the reduction of plot to pure argument or of fictional characters and relationships to bloodless embodiments of ideas. True art is a conduit between body and soul, between feeling unabstracted and abstraction unfelt. Philosophy is more concerned with coherence than with what William James called lifes buzzing, blooming confusion. And what philosophy does for actuality, critics do for art. Art gropes. It stalks like a hunter lost in the woods, listening to itself and to everything around it, unsure of itself, waiting to pounce",,1464

It is easy to demonstrate that the patient has been aware of every detail. The prick in the arm or the remark made during an eclipse of consciousness can be recalled as accurately as if there had been no anesthesia or forgetfulness. I recall a woman who was once admitted to the clinic in a state of complete stupor. When she recovered consciousness next day, she knew who she was but did not know where she was, how or why she had come there, or even the date. Yet after I had hypnotized her, she told me why she had fallen ill, how she had got to the clinic, and who had admitted her. All these details could be verified. She was even able to tell the time at which she had been admitted, because she had seen a clock in the entrance hall. Under hypnosis, her memory was as clear as if she had been completely conscious all the time",,918

It is easy to say you want talented people, and you do, but the way those people interact with one another is the real key. Even the smartest people can form an ineffective team if they are mismatched. That means it is better to focus on how a team is performing, not on the talents of the individuals within it. A good team is made up of people who complement each other. There is an important principle here that may seem obvious, yet—in my experience—is not obvious at all.

Then I wont be lost in a collective whole that fits nobody because its made to fit everybody. Wherever I go, from the corner of my eye I see young people moving in groups, like schools of fish. When I was young, we all moved in separate directions. Are we developing a society like ants, in blocs and colonies? This is one of the things I fear more than anything else. I loathe collectivity.

12/11/2015,The Playboy Interview: The Directors,Playboy,"Then, growing up, we find ourselves in profound conflict—a conflict created by having been taught to idealize our lives, to pursue aesthetic and ethical ideals of absolute good or evil. This imposes impossible standards and unattainable aspirations that can only impede the spontaneous growth of a normal human being, and may conceivably destroy him. You must have experienced this yourself. There arrives a moment in life when you discover that what youve been told at home, in school or in church is simply not true. You discover that it binds your authentic self, your instinct, your true growth. And this opens up a schism, creates a conflict that must eventually be resolved—or succumbed to. In all forms of neurosis there is this clash between certain forms of idealization in a moral sense and a contrary aesthetic form. It all started with the Greeks when they enshrined a classical standard of physical beauty. A man who did not correspond to that type of beauty felt himself excluded, inferior, an outsider. Then came Christianity, which established an ethical beauty. This doubled mans problems by creating the dual possibility that he was neither beautiful as a Greek god nor holy as a Catholic one. Inevitably, you were guilty of either nonbeauty or unsaintliness, and probably both. So you lived in disgrace: Man did not love you, nor did God; thus you remained outside of life",,1391

The Sephoras skipper, his most dramatic antagonist, is also the protagonists foil, a character who illuminates the captain by contrast—Lucy Steele to his Elinor Dashwood.

When the painter looks at Vermeers masterly Woman with a Water Jug, she doesnt mull what the map of Europe hanging in the background represents: the absence of the womans husband or lover, traveling far away? The expansion of Dutch trade throughout the continent and beyond during the seventeenth century? (These are the sorts of things that concern art historians.) Instead, the painter wonders how Vermeer created the illusion of light and air with nothing but oil paints and a square of stretched canvas. She looks at the picture, long and hard, for practical lessons in color and composition and so forth—and she learns. Then she hurries home to her studio and tries out what shes picked up from the incomparable Dutch master",,1023
