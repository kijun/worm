6/11/23,Siddhartha (with Biographical Afterword): A Novel,"This stone is just a stone, it is worthless, it belongs to the world of the Maja; but because it might be able to become also a human being and a spirit in the cycle of transformations, therefore I also grant it importance. Thus, I would perhaps have thought in the past.

6/11/23,Siddhartha (with Biographical Afterword): A Novel,"When someone is searching, said Siddhartha, then it might easily happen that the only thing his eyes still see is that what he searches for, that he is unable to find anything, to let anything enter his mind, because he always thinks of nothing but the object of his search, because he has a goal, because he is obsessed by the goal. Searching means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal. You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because, striving for your goal, there are many things you dont see, which are directly in front of your eyes"

Welcome was the merchant who offered him linen for sale, welcome was the debtor who sought another loan, welcome was the beggar who told him for one hour the story of his poverty and who was not half as poor as any given Samana. He did not treat the rich foreign merchant any different than the servant who shaved him and the street-vendor whom he let cheat him out of some small change when buying bananas. When Kamaswami came to him, to complain about his worries or to reproach him concerning his business, he listened curiously and happily, was puzzled by him, tried to understand him, consented that he was a little bit right, only as much as he considered indispensable, and turned away from him, towards the next person who would ask for him. And there were many who came to him, many to do business with him, many to cheat him, many to draw some secret out of him, many to appeal to his sympathy, many to get his advice. He gave advice, he pitied, he made gifts, he let them cheat him a bit, and this entire game and the passion with which all people played this game occupied his thoughts just as much as the gods and Brahmans used to occupy them"

In general, entitled people fall into one of two traps in their relationships. Either they expect other people to take responsibility for their problems: I wanted a nice relaxing weekend at home. You should have known that and canceled your plans. Or they take on too much responsibility for other peoples problems: She just lost her job again, but its probably my fault because I wasnt as supportive of her as I could have been. Im going to help her rewrite her résumé tomorrow"

There are some experiences that you can have only when youve lived in the same place for five years, when youve been with the same person for over a decade, when youve been working on the same skill or craft for half your lifetime. Now that Im in my thirties, I can finally recognize that commitment, in its own way, offers a wealth of opportunity and experiences that would otherwise never be available to me, no matter where I went or what I did"

5/31/23,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,"In the final analysis it seems unlikely that an essentially intellectual structure can have the same power and aesthetic validity, all other things being equal, as a structure that appeals simultaneously to our intellect and to subtler faculties, our deepest emotions (sympathy and empathy) and our intuition of realitys process"
5/31/23,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,"The writer, in other words, has done the first job done in all serious fiction—he has created a convincing and illuminating sequence of events—but he has not done the second, which is to mine deeper! as Melville says, dig out the fundamental meaning of events by organizing the imitation of reality around some primary question or theme suggested by the characters concern"
5/31/23,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,"since the life-enhancing value of a course in literature is difficult to measure—since, moreover, many people in a position to put pressure on educational programs have no real experience in or feeling for the arts—it is often tempting to treat life-enhancement courses as courses in useful information, putting them on the same objective level as courses in civics, geometry, or elementary physics"
5/31/23,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,"Good description is symbolic not because the writer plants symbols in it but because, by working in the proper way, he forces symbols still largely mysterious to him up into his conscious mind where, little by little as his fiction progresses, he can work with them and finally understand them. To put this another way, the organized and intelligent fictional dream that will eventually fill the readers mind begins as a largely mysterious dream in the writers mind"
5/31/23,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,"The point of these technical exercises is this: Most apprentice writers underestimate the difficulty of becoming artists; they do not understand or believe that great writers are usually those who, like concert pianists, know many ways of doing everything they do. Knowledge is no substitute for genius; but genius supported by vast technique makes a literary master. Especially just now, when competition for publication is probably greater than ever before, it is helpful for a writer to know technique"
5/31/23,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,"This brief, rough sketch of a possible story raises an extremely important point—a point as fundamental, for the most serious kind of writer, as the concept of the uninterruptible fictional dream. What we have so far, in the sketch weve worked out—and what many quite good writers never go beyond—is a projected piece of fiction that, if well-written, will be no more than a persuasive imitation of reality. It shows how things happen and may imply certain values, but it does not look hard at the meaning of things. It has no real theme. This is a common limitation of second-rate fiction and may sometimes characterize even quite powerful fiction, like Eudora Weltys novel Losing Battles"
5/31/23,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,"From all we have said about plotting in general it should be evident that even in those modern plots in which events happen by laws not immediately visible—as when, for instance, the tattooed man in the circus reveals in the course of a whimsical conversation that he has on his chest a tattoo of the little girl now looking at him, a child he has never before seen, or as when, in Isak Dinesen, a decorous old nun turns abruptly into a monkey—there must be some rational or poetically persuasive basis. We can enjoy a story that has some secret logic we sense but cannot immediately guess; but if we begin to suspect that the basis of profluence is nothing but mad whimsey, we begin to be distracted from the fictional dream by our questions, doubts, and puzzlement, our feeling that the story is getting nowhere. The mad story—surrealist, expressionist, or whatever—must be as carefully plotted as the story with causally related actions"
5/31/23,The Art of Fiction: Notes on Craft for Young Writers,"True artists, whatever smiling faces they may show you, are obsessive, driven people—whether driven by some mania or driven by some high, noble vision need not presently concern us. Anyone who has worked both as artist and as professor can tell you, I think, that he works very differently in his two styles. No one is more careful, more scrupulously honest, more devoted to his personal vision of the ideal, than a good professor trying to write a book about the Gilgamesh. He may write far into the night, he may avoid parties, he may feel pangs of guilt about having spent too little time with his family. Nevertheless, his work is no more like an artists work than the work of a first-class accountant is like that of an athlete contending for a championship. He uses faculties of the mind more easily available to us; he has, on all sides of him, stays, checks, safeties, rules of procedure that guide and secure him. Hes a man sure of where he stands in the world. He belongs on sunlit walkways, in ivied halls. With the artist, not so. No critical study, however brilliant, is the fierce psychological battle a novel is. The qualities that make a true artist—nearly the same qualities that make a true athlete—make it important that the student writer never be prevented from working as seriously as he knows how to. In university courses we do exercises. Term papers, quizzes, final examinations are not meant for publication. We move through a course on Dostoevsky or Poe as we move through a mildly good cocktail party, picking up the good bits of food or conversation, bearing with the rest, going home when it comes to seem the reasonable thing to do. Art, at those moments when it feels most like art—when we feel most alive, most alert, most triumphant—is less like a cocktail party than a tank full of sharks. Everythings for keeps, nothings just for exercise"

5/26/23,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),"But, if thats the case, you must also know that you have never fully lived out your thoughts, and that isnt good. Only the thoughts that we live out have any value. You knew that your permissible world was only half the world, and you tried to hide away the second half from yourself, the way clergymen and teachers do. You wont succeed! No one can do that when he has once begun to think"
5/26/23,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),"Fine, I objected, but what then comprises the worth of the individual? Why do we still strive for things when everything is already there within us? Stop right there! Pistorius shouted. Theres a big difference between merely carrying the world inside you and knowing that you do! A madman can produce ideas that resemble Platos, and a pious little schoolboy in a Herrnhut institute7 can creatively reconstruct profound mythological associations in his mind, ideas to be found in the Gnostics or Zoroaster. But he doesnt know hes doing it! Hes a tree or a stone, at best an animal, just as long as he doesnt know that. But when the first spark of that knowledge"
5/26/23,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),"In the clouds I could see a great city from which poured millions of people, who spread out in swarms over wide stretches of countryside. Into their midst there stepped a powerful divine figure, sparkling stars in its hair, tall as a mountain chain, with the features of Lady Eve. Into that figure, as if into a gigantic cave, the columns of people vanished, and were lost from view. The goddess crouched down on the ground, the mark on her forehead gleaming brightly. A dream seemed to overpower her, she shut her eyes, and her huge face was distorted with pain. Suddenly she screamed shrilly, and from her forehead shot stars, many thousands of radiant stars, which flung themselves across the black sky in splendid arcs and semicircles"
5/26/23,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),"Our religion is practiced as if it werent one. It behaves as if it were entirely rational. In a pinch I could be a Catholic, but a Protestant clergyman—no! The handful of true believers—I know some—abide by the literal meaning; I couldnt tell them, for example, that for me Christ is not an individual, but a hero, a myth, an enormous shadow in which mankind sees its own image cast onto the wall of eternity. And the rest, those who come to church to hear a wise saying, to fulfill a duty, to avoid being negligent, and so on, what was I supposed to tell them? Was I to convert them, you think? But I dont want to. A priest isnt out for conversions, he wants to live only among believers, people like himself; he wants to be the bearer and the spokesman of the emotion out of which we create our gods"
5/26/23,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),"glimmers, he becomes a human being. You certainly dont consider all the bipeds running around the street to be human beings merely because they walk upright and carry their young for nine months? After all, you see how many of them are fish or sheep, worms or leeches, how many are ants, how many are bees! Now, each one of them has the potentiality of becoming a human being, but only when he senses that potential, when he even learns to be conscious of it to some degree, does that potential belong to him. Our conversations were more or less of that type. They seldom offered me anything completely new or totally surprising. But all of them, even the most banal, hit the same spot in me with a steady, gentle hammer blow; they all helped form my character, they all helped to strip dead skins off me, to crush eggshells; and after each one I raised my head a little higher, a little more freely, until my yellow bird pushed its beautiful predators head out of the shattered globe"
5/26/23,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),"All right. But you yourself mustnt be a moralist, either! You shouldnt compare yourself with others; and if nature has made you a bat, you shouldnt try to turn yourself into an ostrich. You sometimes think youre peculiar, you reproach yourself for going other ways than most people. Youve got to get that out of your head. Look into the fire, look into the clouds, and as soon as your presentiments come and the voices in your soul begin to speak, surrender yourself to them and dont start off by asking whether that suits or pleases your teacher, your father, or some God or other! If you do that, youll ruin yourself. That way you get on the sidewalk and you become a fossil. My friend Sinclair, our god is named Abraxas; he is God and Satan; both the bright world and the dark world are contained in him. Abraxas has no objections to any of your thoughts or any of your dreams. Never forget that. But hell abandon you if you ever become faultless and normal. Then hell abandon you and look for a new pot to cook his ideas in"
5/26/23,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),"But another time she told me another tale. It was about a man who loved without hope. He withdrew completely inside himself, and thought he would burn up with love. He lost contact with the world; he no longer saw the blue sky and the green forest; the brook didnt murmur for him, the harp didnt sound for him; everything had gone under, and he had become poor and miserable. But his love grew, and he was much readier to die and wither away than to renounce the possession of the beautiful woman he loved. Then he noticed that his love had burnt up everything else in him; it became powerful and exerted more and more attraction; and the beautiful woman was compelled to follow; she came, he stood there with outstretched arms to draw her to himself. But when she stood before him, she was totally transformed, and with trembling he felt and saw that he had attracted to himself the entire world he had lost. It stood before him and yielded itself to him; sky and forest and brook, everything came to meet him in new colors, vivid and splendid; it belonged to him, it spoke his language. And instead of merely winning a woman, he had the whole world on his bosom, and every star in the sky shone within him and sparkled joy into his soul.—He had loved and, by doing so, had found himself. But most people love in order to lose themselves"
5/26/23,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),"And at that point the realization suddenly burned me like a searing flame: For each person there was an office, but for nobody was there one that he was permitted to choose for himself, to define, and to fill according to his own wishes. It was wrong to desire new gods, it was totally wrong to try and give the world anything! There was no duty for enlightened people, none, none, except this: to seek themselves, to become certain of themselves, to grope forward along their own path, wherever it might lead.—I was deeply affected by that, and for me that was the profit from that experience. I had often played with images of the future, I had dreamt of roles that might be meant for me, as a poet, perhaps, or as a prophet, or as a painter, or whatever else. That was all meaningless. I didnt exist to write poetry, to preach sermons, to paint pictures; neither I nor anyone else existed for that purpose. All of that merely happened to a person along the way. Everyone had only one true vocation: to find himself. Let him wind up as a poet or a madman, as a prophet or a criminal—that wasnt his business; in the long run, it was irrelevant. His business was to discover his own destiny, not just any destiny, and to live it totally and undividedly. Anything else was just a half-measure, an attempt to run away, an escape back to the ideal of the masses, an adaptation, fear of ones own nature. Fearsome and sacred, the new image rose up before me; I had sensed it a hundred times, perhaps I had already enunciated it, but now I was experiencing it for the first time. I was a gamble of Nature, a throw of the dice into an uncertain realm, leading perhaps to something new, perhaps to nothing; and to let this throw from the primordial depths take effect, to feel its will inside myself and adopt it completely as my own will: that alone was my vocation. That alone!"
5/26/23,Demian (Dover Thrift Editions: Classic Novels),"Community, Demian said, is a fine thing. But the type we see blossoming all over isnt true community. It will originate anew, out of the knowledge that individuals have of one another, and for a while it will transform the world. The kind of community we have now is merely herd instinct. People run to one another for shelter because theyre afraid of one another—capitalists stick together, workers stick together, scholars stick together! And why are they afraid? A person is afraid only when he isnt at one with himself. Theyre afraid because they have never accepted themselves. A community consisting exclusively of people afraid of the unknown in themselves! They all feel that the rules they live by are no longer valid, that theyre following outdated commandments; neither their religions nor their morality, nothing is suited to what we need. For a century and more, Europe has done nothing but study and build factories! They know exactly how many grams of powder it takes to kill someone, but they dont know how to pray to God, they dont even know how to be contented for an hour at a time. Just take a look at a students tavern like these! Or even a pleasure resort that rich people go to! Hopeless!—My dear Sinclair, no serenity can come from any of that. These people who rub elbows so anxiously are filled with fear and filled with malice, none of them trusts anyone else. They cling to ideals that no longer count, and they cast stones at everyone who proclaims a new one. I foresee confrontations. Theyll come, believe me, theyll come soon! Naturally, they wont improve the world. Whether the workers kill the factory owners or Russia and Germany shoot at each other, that will only mean a change of ownership. But it wont all be for nothing. It will show clearly just how worthless todays ideals are; there will be a clearing out of Stone Age gods. This world, as it now is, wants to die, it wants to perish, and it will"

5/19/23,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,"Whenever I try to fathom how my friend Knecht managed to do anything with a person as confirmedly unhappy as myself, I see more and more plainly that his power was based on magic and, I must add, on a streak of roguishness. He was an arch-rogue, far more than his own underlings realized, full of playfulness, wit, slyness, delighting in magicians tricks, in guises, in surprising disappearances and appearances"
5/19/23,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,"Awakening, it seemed, was not so much concerned with truth and cognition, but with experiencing and proving oneself in the real world. When you had such an awakening, you did not penetrate any closer to the core of things, to truth; you grasped, accomplished, or endured only the attitude of your own ego to the momentary situation. You did not find laws, but came to decisions; you did not thrust your way into the center of the world, but into the center of your own individuality"
5/19/23,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,"More and more he had to bid farewell to the dream, the feeling and the pleasure of infinite potentialities, of a multiplicity of futures. Instead of the dream of unending progress, of the sum of all wisdom, his pupil stood by, a small, near, demanding reality, an intruder and nuisance, but no longer to be rebuffed or evaded. For the boy represented, after all, the only way into the real future, the one most important duty, the one narrow path along which the Rainmakers life and acts, principles, thoughts, and glimmerings could be saved from death and continue their life in a small new bud. Sighing, gnashing his teeth, and smiling, he accepted the burden"
5/19/23,The Glass Bead Game: (Magister Ludi) A Novel,"Worldly people are children, my son. And saints—well, they do not come to confess to us. But you and I and our kind, we ascetics and seekers and eremites—we are not children and are not innocent and cannot be set straight by moralizing sermons. We are the real sinners, we who know and think, who have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, and we should not treat one another like children who are given a few blows of the rod and left to go their way again. After a confession and penance we do not run away back to the world where children celebrate feasts and do business and now and then kill one another. We do not experience sin like a brief bad dream which can be thrown off by confession and sacrifice; we dwell in it. We are never innocent; we are always sinners; we dwell in sin and in the fire of conscience, and we know that we can never pay our great debt unless after our departure God looks mercifully upon us and receives us into His grace. That, Joseph, is the reason I cannot deliver sermons and dictate penances to you and me. We are not involved in one or another misstep or crime, but always and forever in original sin itself. This is why each of us can only assure the other that he shares his knowledge and feels brotherly love; neither of us can cure the other by penances. Surely you must have known this?"

5/13/23,The Modern Library Writer&#39;s Workshop: A Guide to the Craft of Fiction (Modern Library Paperbacks),"The way—the only way—to find your story is to tell it. Nobody in the whole world has ever before told the story you are about to tell. You yourself have never told it to anyone, not even to yourself. You may have lots of intuitions about what the story is going to be, and you may even have a sort of summary overview of it. These are good and useful things to have; they are fine places to start. They are not enough. Until you actually tell the story, the whole story, it will be nothing but smoke"
5/13/23,The Modern Library Writer&#39;s Workshop: A Guide to the Craft of Fiction (Modern Library Paperbacks),"There is no individuality in fiction without the typical. A character's type is the doorway through which she or he enters the reader's imagination. If you are afraid to show how a character is typical, you will never be able to show anything special about her or him either. We are none of us sui generis. We are all typical of something; in fact, we are typical of many things. At the same time, we are all also absolute individuals: uniquely ourselves, facing our fate in the universe alone. In art as in life, we can face that fate only while occupying some definable place in the world, and our individualism can articulate itself only through the lingua franca that comes with our role"

There was no lessening of internal conflict, but only a marked non-defensiveness in experiencing such conflicts3 among their subjects. The implications of these findings are profound, because Brown and Engler discovered that meditation, on its own, is not particularly effective at solving peoples emotional problems. It can prepare the ground, so to speak, by making the person more accepting and less defensive, but without a therapists intervention, there is a very real danger of paralysis. We are faced here with our first conundrum: Meditation, it seems, can bestow the kind of ego strength necessary for a successful psychotherapy, but it cannot do the psychotherapy by itself"

But desire gives one a reason to tolerate anxiety and a willingness to push through it"
5/2/23,Open to Desire: The Truth About What the Buddha Taught,"In the early Buddhist traditions, desire was viewed as a poison to be avoided.

5/2/23,Open to Desire: The Truth About What the Buddha Taught,"Early in the morning, before his first day of teaching, the Dalai Lama gave money away to all who came. Somehow the word must have gotten out, because before dawn I was awakened by clouds of dust rising from the feet of the crowds descending on his tent. This event was no abstract cultivation of generosity or loving kindness, nor was it an offering of teachings on wisdom: It was alms-giving on a mammoth scale.

They treat their children more as objects than as individuals who already are themselves. Children feel this as a burden. A pressure, the lama replied. A pressure. And they develop an armor to guard against it. The anger is a reflection of that armor. I thought of a patient of mine as we talked, a young woman who always felt that her parents, in her words, had a quota on me. She had the feeling that they just couldnt take her, that she was too much for them—too imposing, too difficult, too unrestrained, and at the same time a disappointment: not enough of the right stuff. This woman withdrew from her mother and father, shielding herself from them, but she withdrew from other people in a more generalizable way, and suffered from lack of confidence and isolation as a result"

Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact, and that is: everything around you that you call life was made up by people who were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. That's the most important thing: to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you're just going to live in it. Versus embrace it, change it, make it better.

4/18/23,The War of Art,The concept in all these environments seems to be that one needs to complete his healing before he is ready to do his work.   This way of thinking (are you ahead of me?) is a form of Resistance

4/18/23,The War of Art,"Marines love to be miserable.

4/18/23,The War of Art,"Remember, the part of us that we imagine needs healing is not the part we create from; that part is far deeper and stronger.

4/18/23,The War of Art,"When I began this book, Resistance almost beat me. This is the form it took.

4/18/23,The War of Art,"These characters might not be interesting to anyone else but theyre absolutely fascinating to us. They are us. Meaner, smarter, sexier versions of ourselves. Its fun to be with them because theyre wrestling with the same issue that has its hooks into us. Theyre our soul mates, our lovers, our best friends. Even the villains. Especially the villains"
4/18/23,The War of Art,"Dont get me wrong. Ive got nothing against true healing. We all need it. But it has nothing to do with doing our work and it can be a colossal exercise in Resistance. Resistance loves healing. Resistance knows that the more psychic energy we expend dredging and re-dredging the tired, boring injustices of our personal lives, the less juice we have to do our work"
4/18/23,The War of Art,"Of course this is exactly what happens. But heres the trick. We wind up in space, but not alone. Instead we are tapped into an unquenchable, undepletable, inexhaustible source of wisdom, consciousness, companionship. Yeah, we lose friends. But we find friends too, in places we never thought to look. And theyre better friends, truer friends. And were better and truer to them"
4/18/23,The War of Art,"The Ego hates the Self because when we seat our consciousness in the Self, we put the ego out of business.   The Ego doesnt want us to evolve. The Ego runs the show right now. It likes things just the way they are.   The instinct that pulls us toward art is the impulse to evolve, to learn, to heighten and elevate our consciousness. The Ego hates this. Because the more awake we become, the less we need the Ego"
4/18/23,The War of Art,"What does Resistance feel like?   First, unhappiness. We feel like hell. A low-grade misery pervades everything. Were bored, were restless. We cant get no satisfaction. Theres guilt but we cant put our finger on the source. We want to go back to bed; we want to get up and party. We feel unloved and unlovable. Were disgusted. We hate our lives. We hate ourselves.   Unalleviated, Resistance mounts to a pitch that becomes unendurable. At this point vices kick in. Dope, adultery, web surfing"
4/18/23,The War of Art,"This is the most terrifying prospect a human being can face, because it ejects him at one go (he imagines) from all the tribal inclusions his psyche is wired for and has been for fifty million years.   We fear discovering that we are more than we think we are. More than our parents/children/teachers think we are. We fear that we actually possess the talent that our still, small voice tells us. That we actually have the guts, the perseverance, the capacity. We fear that we truly can steer our ship, plant our flag, reach our Promised Land. We fear this because, if its true, then we become estranged from all we know. We pass through a membrane. We become monsters and monstrous"
4/18/23,The War of Art,"1) We show up every day. We might do it only because we have to, to keep from getting fired. But we do it. We show up every day.   2) We show up no matter what. In sickness and in health, come hell or high water, we stagger in to the factory. We might do it only so as not to let down our co-workers, or for other, less noble reasons. But we do it. We show up no matter what.   3) We stay on the job all day. Our minds may wander, but our bodies remain at the wheel. We pick up the phone when it rings, we assist the customer when he seeks our help. We dont go home till the whistle blows.   4) We are committed over the long haul. Next year we may go to another job, another company, another country. But well still be working. Until we hit the lottery, we are part of the labor force.   5) The stakes for us are high and real. This is about survival, feeding our families, educating our children. Its about eating.   6) We accept remuneration for our labor. Were not here for fun. We work for money.   7) We do not overidentify with our jobs. We may take pride in our work, we may stay late and come in on weekends, but we recognize that we are not our job descriptions"

4/15/23,Dune,"Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man"

4/12/23,The Alchemist,"The boy and his heart had become friends, and neither was capable now of betraying the other. When his heart spoke to him, it was to provide a stimulus to the boy, and to give him strength, because the days of silence there in the desert were wearisome"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"Its true that everything has its Personal Legend, but one day that Personal Legend will be realized. So each thing has to transform itself into something better, and to acquire a new Personal Legend, until, someday, the Soul of the World becomes one thing only"

It asks things of me, and it keeps me from sleeping many nights, when Im thinking about her. Well, thats good. Your heart is alive. Keep listening to what it has to say"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"We, their hearts, become fearful just thinking of loved ones who go away forever, or of moments that could have been good but werent, or of treasures that might have been found but were forever hidden in the sands. Because, when these things happen, we suffer terribly. My heart is afraid that it will have to suffer"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"Later, we simply let life proceed, in its own direction, toward its own fate. But, unfortunately, very few follow the path laid out for them—the path to their Personal Legends, and to happiness. Most people see the world as a threatening place, and, because they do, the world turns out, indeed, to be a threatening place"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"Mecca is a lot farther away than the Pyramids. When I was young, all I wanted to do was put together enough money to start this shop. I thought that someday Id be rich, and could go to Mecca. I began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate things"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"And he gave the boy his blessing. The boy could see in his fathers gaze a desire to be able, himself, to travel the world—a desire that was still alive, despite his fathers having had to bury it, over dozens of years, under the burden of struggling for water to drink, food to eat, and the same place to sleep every night of his life"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"All who went there were happy at having done so. They placed the symbols of the pilgrimage on the doors of their houses. One of them, a cobbler who made his living mending boots, said that he had traveled for almost a year through the desert, but that he got more tired when he had to walk through the streets of Tangier buying his leather"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"When I have been truly searching for my treasure, every day has been luminous, because Ive known that every hour was a part of the dream that I would find it. When I have been truly searching for my treasure, Ive discovered things along the way that I never would have seen had I not had the courage to try things that seemed impossible for a shepherd to achieve"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to pray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didnt give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures; it didnt ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal; and it didnt beseech that the woman he had met continue to await his return"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"The boys heart began to speak of fear. It told him stories it had heard from the Soul of the World, stories of men who sought to find their treasure and never succeeded. Sometimes it frightened the boy with the idea that he might not find his treasure, or that he might die there in the desert. At other times, it told the boy that it was satisfied: it had found love and riches"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"Im already used to the way things are. Before you came, I was thinking about how much time I had wasted in the same place, while my friends had moved on, and either went bankrupt or did better than they had before. It made me very depressed. Now, I can see that it hasnt been too bad. The shop is exactly the size I always wanted it to be. I dont want to change anything, because I dont know how to deal with change. Im used to the way I am"
4/12/23,The Alchemist,"Because its not love to be static like the desert, nor is it love to roam the world like the wind. And its not love to see everything from a distance, like you do. Love is the force that transforms and improves the Soul of the World. When I first reached through to it, I thought the Soul of the World was perfect. But later, I could see that it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we live in will be either better or worse, depending on whether we become better or worse. And thats where the power of love comes in"

4/3/23,The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology,"Our world runs on desire. We would not have been born without sexual desire. Without continuing desire we would die. There is desire for love, connection, understanding, growth. When people lose their desire to live, they jump off a bridge or swallow pills. We need desire. And yet desire is also a great challenge for us. Mistakenly, many people think that Buddhism condemns all desire. But there is no getting rid of desire.

4/3/23,The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology,"I followed the breath for a long time and practiced mindfulness. Nothing seemed to be happening. Then I realized that the objects of my awareness began to have texture. By texture I mean depth. This texture is deceptive because it first arises from the memory or imagination. Soon the texture reveals clarity. This is a movement to present awareness without the distorting effects of memory or imagination. My mind settled and I gave up all struggle. I live this way now as much as I can. I dont know if this is what is supposed to happen. But its what happens with me. I became still. I learned to listen, to care"
4/3/23,The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology,"At the same time I invited Margot to practice living in the present. Practicing mindfulness, she began to be able to feel her body and focus on its sensations. She could feel her tension, but she could also hear the screech of a scrub jay outside the window and see the slant of the morning light. Coming into her senses, she could see her worry and panic as the product of fearful, imagined stories, not as present truths. Margo also learned mindful walking to feel her steps, to touch the earth in the here and now. Through Brians treatment and hospital visits, his long struggle with cancer, Margo worked diligently with mindfulness to stay in the present. She said it was her only relief"
4/3/23,The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology,"As children, many of us were taught courage in the form of the warrior or the explorer, bravely facing danger. In the Buddhist understanding, however, great courage is not demonstrated by aggression or ambition. Aggression and ambition are more often expressions of fear and delusion. The courageous heart is the one that is unafraid to open to the world. With compassion we come to trust our capacity to open to life without armoring. As the poet Rilke reminds us, Ultimately it is on our vulnerability that we depend. This is not a poetic ideal but a living reality, demonstrated by our most beloved sages. Mahatma Gandhi had the courage to be jailed and beaten, to persevere through difficulties without giving in to bitterness and despair. His vulnerability became his strength"
4/3/23,The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology,"This is how Cynthia later described it. I was gradually able to see that my hungry ghost tendency did not make me a failure as a human being. Because the self-hatred was so intense, I could only say, May this suffering body be healed, may this sad heart be free. And recently, amazingly, when I am able to see the tendency to start on that sad old path, grasping for the illusory magic of food, a compassionate awareness will arise and say, Oh, I dont really want this. It will only lead to pain and sadness. These moments are a miracle really, a release from the agony of the hungry ghost. It is as if, like the temptations of Buddha on his enlightenment night, I can feel the pain, see the grasping, and finally say, I see you, Mara and let it go. This struggle has opened my heart to the suffering of others. Hungry ghosts are around us all the time. Because of my experience I see them in so many people. Its not just food, but any kind of grasping. I feel such compassion because I know how much it hurts. Only by letting go will they heal, will they free their hearts"
4/3/23,The Wise Heart: A Guide to the Universal Teachings of Buddhist Psychology,"psychology describes the state of addiction as becoming a hungry ghost. No matter how much the ghost tries to eat, satisfaction is impossible. This is the state of consciousness where desire becomes insatiable, thirst becomes unquenchable. For the hungry ghost, like an addict, a few moments of relief come with the drink or the high or the binge, followed by a pause and craving for more. The suffering of desire is apparent in addiction, but ordinary desire has its suffering too. We want to be thinner, more charming, admired, successful, secure. We use our desires to distract ourselves from discomfort. When an unconscious feeling of insecurity, boredom, or emptiness arises, desire follows. We open the refrigerator, turn on the TV, lose ourselves in distraction or busyness or addiction. We want another piece of chocolate cake to inspire us, a drink or a tidbit of gossip to make us feel better. Desires act like temporary painkillers—while they are harmless at first, we can become habituated. The more lonely and separate we feel, the more we turn to desires to compensate. We go through our day yanked by the chain of one desire after another until we finally lose touch with who we really are. Though the world may reward us for our drivenness, internally we are diminished. Virginia Woolf describes it this way: If people are highly successful in their professions they lose their senses…. Sight goes. They have no time to look at pictures. Sound goes. They have no time to listen to music. Speech goes. They have no time for conversation. They lose their sense of proportion…. Humanity goes. In modern life, compulsive desire is visible on a global scale: in the greed for oil, the clearing of rain forests, the privatization of rivers and lakes, and the patenting of such human staples as beans and corn. The world, said Ajahn Chah, is in a feverish state. Buddhist activist Helena Norberg-Hodge describes how modern desire has affected the Tibetan communities in Ladakh, India. For a thousand years, they believed they were blessed. They lived simply, with rainfall enough to grow their crops and time to tend their temples and follow the sacred rhythm of their year. When Ladakh first opened to the West in the 1970s, the Ladakhis told their visitors how abundant and rich they felt their lives were. Now, thirty years later, after exposure to television and wristwatches…"

I had been through many years of psychoanalysis and still I had managed to keep private places in my head—I wouldnt say they were big, labeled categories, but they were certain attitudes or feelings that were still very private. And suddenly I realized that he knew everything that was going on in my head, all the time, and that he still loved me. Because who we are is behind all that"
3/19/23,Be Here Now (Enhanced Edition),"But there was no conversation. I didnt know anything about his life. He didnt know anything about my life. He wasnt the least bit interested in all of the extraordinary dramas that I had collected . . . He was the first person I couldnt seduce into being interested in all this. He just didnt care.

3/19/23,Be Here Now (Enhanced Edition),"The first is to avoid the fulfilling of the still-active desires, using the energy instead for specific acts of purification. The second alternative is to use the energy to fulfill the desire once again, but simultaneously to be conscious of the entire process, that is, use the experience to get finished with the desire. This second method, called ban marg, or the left-handed path, is very risky. Most people who attempt to use it are not successful and succeed only in creating more karma. However, it is such a seductive route that most Westerners prefer it and wrap their subsequent failure in layers of rationalization. What is required"
3/19/23,Be Here Now (Enhanced Edition),"On the surface, this method looks like what psychologists call the defense mechanism of dissociation. A girl goes to a dance and no one asks her to dance . . . and she adopts a superior separateness . . . watching it all with the thought: I couldnt be less interested in dancing. This response of separating herself from her desire arises because she so badly wants to dance. It must be differentiated from the adoption of a witness when you have finished with dancing, so to speak. The witness we are considering here is hardly an unconscious defense mechanism. Though they look alike on the surface, they are quite different. But only you know which is which"
3/19/23,Be Here Now (Enhanced Edition),"The difficulty with adding just any third party is that you might attribute to that other person certain motives or values. In order to avoid that, it is useful to pick the third focal point with an eye towards your goal of enlightenment. That is, pick someone who is already enlightened, such as Krishna or Ram or a Buddha or Christ. They see it all. They are beyond it all. They understand how it all is. As they watch you digging the ditch, they see the act in all its cosmic significance . . . its the first and last digging of a ditch. They understand why you are doing it and all the thoughts in your head, all your history, and they even understand the future—how it is when the ditch is all dug. And from this vantage point they have total compassion, total appreciation for all that is involved. To run the act of you digging a ditch through one of their heads allows you to get free of the ego-centric predicament, I am digging a ditch"

The younger cows, less mature in their wisdom, stumble apprehensively on the shore, but eventually they go forward and cross the stream. Last come the calves, trembling with fear, some just learning how to stand. But these vulnerable, tender calves also get to the other side, the Buddha said. They cross the stream just by following the lowing of their mothers. The calves trust their mothers and, anticipating the safety of reunion, follow their voices and cross the stream.

3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"And Polo said: Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice. When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them. And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice. To distinguish the other cities qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit. For me it is Venice"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"But Marco cannot do this: he has not succeeded in discovering which is the city that those of the plateau call Irene. For that matter, it is of slight importance: if you saw it, standing in its midst, it would be a different city; Irene is a name for a city in the distance, and if you approach, it changes"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"The city, however, does not tell its past, but contains it like the lines of a hand, written in the corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennae of the lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"The empire is being crushed by its own weight, Kublai thinks, and in his dreams now cities light as kites appear, pierced cities like laces, cities transparent as mosquito netting, cities like leaves veins, cities lined like a hands palm, filigree cities to be seen through their opaque and fictitious thickness"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"But this would not be true, either: at certain hours, in certain places along the street, you see opening before you the hint of something unmistakable, rare, perhaps magnificent; you would like to say what it is, but everything previously said of Aglaura imprisons your words and obliges you to repeat rather than say"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"And yet I have constructed in my mind a model city from which all possible cities can be deduced, Kublai said. It contains everything corresponding to the norm. Since the cities that exist diverge in varying degree from the norm, I need only foresee the exceptions to the norm and calculate the most probable combinations"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"Such is the power, sometimes called malignant, sometimes benign, that Anastasia, the treacherous city, possesses; if for eight hours a day you work as a cutter of agate, onyx, chrysoprase, your labor which gives form to desire takes from desire its form, and you believe you are enjoying Anastasia wholly when you are only its slave"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"There are two ways of describing the city of Dorothea: you can say that four aluminum towers rise from its walls flanking seven gates with spring-operated drawbridges that span the moat whose water feeds four green canals which cross the city, dividing it into nine quarters, each with three hundred houses and seven hundred chimneys"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"Melanias population renews itself: the participants in the dialogues die one by one and meanwhile those who will take their places are born, some in one role, some in another.

3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"In languages incomprehensible to the Khan, the envoys related information heard in languages incomprehensible to them: from this opaque, dense stridor emerged the revenues received by the imperial treasury, the first and last names of officials dismissed and decapitated, the dimensions of the canals that the narrow rivers fed in times of drought"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"At times all I need is a brief glimpse, an opening in the midst of an incongruous landscape, a glint of lights in the fog, the dialogue of two passersby meeting in the crowd, and I think that, setting out from there, I will put together, piece by piece, the perfect city, made of fragments mixed with the rest, of instants separated by intervals, of signals one sends out, not knowing who receives them"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"Nothing exists or happens in the one Valdrada that the other Valdrada does not repeat, because the city was so constructed that its every point would be reflected in its mirror, and the Valdrada down in the water contains not only all the flutings and juttings of the facades that rise above the lake, but also the rooms interiors with ceilings and floors, the perspective of the halls, the mirrors of the wardrobes"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"I speak and speak, Marco says, but the listener retains only the words he is expecting. The description of the world to which you lend a benevolent ear is one thing; the description that will go the rounds of the groups of stevedores and gondoliers on the street outside my house the day of my return is another; and yet another, that which I might dictate late in life, if I were taken prisoner by Genoese pirates and put in irons in the same cell with a writer of adventure stories"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"It is a city made only of exceptions, exclusions, incongruities, contradictions. If such a city is the most improbable, by reducing the number of abnormal elements, we increase the probability that the city really exists. So I have only to subtract exceptions from my model, and in whatever direction I proceed, I will arrive at one of the cities which, always as an exception, exist. But I cannot force my operation beyond a certain limit: I would achieve cities too probable to be real"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"According to others, the gods live in the buckets that rise, suspended from a cable, as they appear over the edge of the wells, in the revolving pulleys, in the windlasses of the norias, in the pump handles, in the blades of the windmills that draw the water up from the drillings, in the trestles that support the twisting probes, in the reservoirs perched on stilts over the roofs, in the slender arches of the aqueducts, in all the columns of water, the vertical pipes, the plungers, the drains, all the way up to the weathercocks that surmount the airy scaffoldings of Isaura, a city that moves entirely upward"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"You do not come to Euphemia only to buy and sell, but also because at night, by the fires all around the market, seated on sacks or barrels or stretched out on piles of carpets, at each word that one man says—such as wolf, sister, hidden treasure, battle, scabies, lovers—the others tell, each one, his tale of wolves, sisters, treasures, scabies, lovers, battles. And you know that in the long journey ahead of you, when to keep awake against the camels swaying or the junks rocking, you start summoning up your memories one by one, your wolf will have become another wolf, your sister a different sister, your battle other battles, on your return from Euphemia, the city where memory is traded at every solstice and at every equinox"
3/12/23,Invisible Cities,"Contemplating these essential landscapes, Kublai reflected on the invisible order that sustains cities, on the rules that decreed how they rise, take shape and prosper, adapting themselves to the seasons, and then how they sadden and fall in ruins. At times he thought he was on the verge of discovering a coherent, harmonious system underlying the infinite deformities and discords, but no model could stand up to the comparison with the game of chess. Perhaps, instead of racking ones brain to suggest with the ivory pieces scant help visions which were anyway destined to oblivion, it would suffice to play a game according to the rules, and to consider each successive state of the board as one of the countless forms that the system of forms assembles and destroys"

3/2/23,"No Mud, No Lotus: The Art of Transforming Suffering","When we stop the busyness of the mind and come back to ourselves, the enormity and rawness of our suffering can seem very intense because we are so used to ignoring it and distracting ourselves. When we feel suffering, we have the urge to run away from it and fill ourselves up with junk food, junk entertainment, anything to keep our mind off the pain that is there inside us. It doesnt work. We may succeed in numbing ourselves from it for a little while, but the suffering inside wants our attention and it will fester and churn away until it gets it"

On the other hand, I knew my greatest happiness would be to live as a monk.

2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,There is nothing more important to true growth than realizing that you are not the voice of the mind—you are the one who hears it
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"When you just look without creating thoughts, your consciousness is effortlessly aware of, and fully comprehends, all that it sees"

2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,You do this by setting the direction of your life when youre clear and not letting the wavering mind deter you. Your will is stronger than the habit of listening to that voice. There is nothing you cant do
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"It doesnt make any difference what its saying, you are the one who is aware of it. As long as you think that one thing its saying is you, but the other thing its saying is not you, youve lost your objectivity"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"Youre welcome to deal with it, but first let the energy make it through you. If you dont, you will not actually be dealing with the current event, you will be dealing with your own blocked energies from the past"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"Youre ready to grow when you finally realize that the I who is always talking inside will never be content. It always has a problem with something. Honestly, when was the last time you really had nothing bothering you?"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"What is it inside of us that even has the ability to resist the reality of life? If you look carefully inside yourself, you will see that its you, the Self, the indwelling being, that has this power. It is called willpower"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"Stop and think about what youre capable of achieving. Up to now, your capacities have been constrained by constant inner struggles. Imagine what would happen if your awareness was free to focus only on the events actually taking place"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,Plenty of events make it right through you. Why did you decide to resist this one? Something inside of you must have a basis for deciding when to simply let things pass through and when to assert willpower to either push them away or cling to them
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"When a problem is disturbing you, dont ask, What should I do about it? Ask, What part of me is being disturbed by this? If you ask, What should I do about it? youve already fallen into believing that there really is a problem outside that must be dealt with"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"In other words, if somebody does something that stimulates fear, you think they did something wrong. You then do everything you can to make sure they never do it again. First you defend yourself, and then you protect yourself. You do whatever you can to keep from feeling disturbance"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,The alternative is to use life to let go of these impressions and the stress they create. In order to do this you have to become very conscious. You have to carefully watch the mental voice that tells you to resist something. It literally commands you: I dont like what he said. Fix it
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"The power of Self, when it is concentrated and directed into the physical, mental, or emotional realms, creates a force, and we call that force will. Thats what you use when you try to make things happen or not happen. You are not helpless in there; you have the power to affect things"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"When you resist, the energy has no place to go. It gets stuck in your psyche and seriously affects you. It blocks your hearts energy flow and causes you to feel closed and less vibrant. This is literally what is happening when something is weighing on your mind or when things just get too heavy for you"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"If youre willing to be objective and watch all your thoughts, you will see that the vast majority of them have no relevance. They have no effect on anything or anybody, except you. They are simply making you feel better or worse about what is going on now, what has gone on in the past, or what might go on in the future"
2/25/23,The Untethered Soul: The Journey Beyond Yourself,"Youre walking outside in the winter, you start to shiver, and the voice says, Its cold! Now how did that help you? You already knew it was cold. Youre the one whos experiencing the cold. Why is it telling you this? You re-create the world within your mind because you can control your mind whereas you cant control the world"

2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,The reason that we struggle to maintain the egoic state is because it allows us to live our lives as if we are in control and separate from the world around us
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"When we really begin to look at suffering, what suffers is me and you. Its our sense of self that suffers, that feels strain, anxiety, alienation, and loneliness"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"The seeker should not stop until he finds. When he does find, he will be disturbed. After being disturbed, he will be astonished. Then he will reign over everything"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,If were not honestly willing to look at the whole structure of who we think we are and be open to the idea that maybe weve been completely wrong about ourselves—maybe
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Youre caught in it, and once youre caught in it youll tend to try to grasp for more control as a means of getting out, and youll only dig yourself in deeper and deeper"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Our sense of self is very ephemeral; its not as solid as we imagine it to be, and the confusion around it is one of the greatest causes of human suffering that there is"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Why is it that human beings have such a difficult time putting their suffering down? Whats the reason that we often carry it around, when it becomes such a burden to us?"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"you had nothing else but today? All of a sudden, you would look at your whole existence through completely different eyes. See if you can feel what it is to exist only now"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"One of the things that we all do when we get exposed to spiritual teachings, especially teachings that we dont particularly understand, is that we abdicate our own authority"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Its a way that we keep bumping into life. When we collide with life in this way, we always feel interior friction, and we can never find the inner stability for which we yearn"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"All of a sudden, we may decide that were a terrible person because someone was critical of us, said something unkind about us, or told us that they really didnt like us anymore"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"as soon as we start to believe thoughts that cause us to feel angry or greedy or frustrated or out of control, we get pulled into the hypnotizing vortex of sorrow and suffering"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"As soon as you believe that a label youve put on yourself is true, youve limited something that is literally limitless, youve limited who you are into nothing more than a thought"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Who really wants to find out that were all addicted to qualities like approval, recognition, control, and power, and that none of these things actually brings an end to suffering?"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Its important to see, from an egoic state of consciousness, that many of the qualities that pull us into the vortex are qualities of mind and emotion that our egos find very valuable"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"from. In other words, we can be so transcendent that were literally free from life. But at some point in time, we come to see that this is a relatively immature idea of what freedom is"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Experience the same memory, but withhold your story, withhold the conclusions your mind has made. Dont judge yourself for making them; just see if you can experience the story without them"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Its a state of great availability, and its from this state of great availability and openness, from this willingness to realize how little we really know, that our consciousness begins to shift"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"But by relinquishing our need and desire to control, explain, and believe the way that our minds talk to us about what was and what is, we find a capacity to open to a new state of consciousness"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Egoic consciousness isnt just a mental phenomenon. The ego also holds tightly onto emotions and feelings, and also onto a general sort of energetic quality that goes along with this egoic trance"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"And each time I was stopped, grace would reveal itself. As time went on, I realized that I didnt have to struggle so hard, I didnt have to fight with life or with myself in order to open to grace"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"when were in deep states of suffering, were usually so overwhelmed by the experience of emotion that we forget and become unconscious of the story in our minds that is creating and maintaining it"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Listening is the first step in discovering our autonomy, an autonomy that, if we take this search for our own happiness and freedom all the way, will fully flower one day into something we cant imagine"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"When were in relationship and two people get pulled into this vortex, the cycle of conflict and misunderstanding really strengthens, as well as the perceived need to defend, control, and blame the other"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"We all have this innate desire to be free, creative, loving, open, and compassionate—and yet when were trapped within the egoic state of consciousness, in this trance of ego, our options are very limited"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"We think that it is simply a matter of coming up with the right thoughts, the right ideas, the right beliefs, then well find the key to peace, and from there we will all begin to get along with each other"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"It doesnt have to be a particularly positive feeling; some people are identified with a very dense, heavy state of suffering, but when they feel that heavy state of suffering, they feel most like themselves"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"What I realized was that adults spent a lot of time thinking, and more important than that—and more odd, it seemed to me—they actually believed what they were thinking. They believed the thoughts in their head"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Instead of trying to control our minds or environments by contracting or hiding in order to find this inner stillness, we must throw our senses wide open—listening, feeling, seeing—and become very wide and vast"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"something thats not just in thought. Revelation and insight come from somewhere else, from some other space. They come from a place that we as a culture seem to have so little respect for—a place called silence"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Strangely, the more we struggle to get out of these states, the deeper we sink into them. The more we try to figure them out, the more we make ourselves confused, when what we really need to do is to begin to listen"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Theres a lot of knowing thats very useful, but when it comes to our state of consciousness, when it comes to finding peace and happiness, we have to let go of knowing. We have to let go of the effort to know, because really, we dont know"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,What is the nature of the relationship that we as this deep well of unknowing awareness have with this moment? It is simply allowing this moment to be as it is; it is the space that allows whatever arises in this moment to be that which it is
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"We dont really want to end suffering. What we really want to do is manage our suffering, to have a little bit less of it, so that we can just go on with our lives as they are, unchanged, the way we want to live them, maybe feeling a little better about them"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"The unknowing is itself aware, is itself conscious. The Tibetan Buddhists call this self-luminosity. The deepest reality of who we are is this open field of awareness that is self-luminous, self-knowing. In other words, who and what we truly are knows itself"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"The unknown is a very intimate place. You may feel very exposed when you open yourself to this inner space of unknowing, but really, the unknown is our only doorway. Its by allowing ourselves to not know that we can become truly sensitive, open, and available"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"When we see ourselves as essentially separate, then we start to think that I have to take care of me, that my needs and my wants are of utmost importance, and so we have to make sure that we get what we want, irrespective of what someone else may want or need"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"When we see and stay with what is, it actually opens up creative responses, new ways of seeing and engaging with what is, which arent based on separation or denial or trying to control, but instead are sourced in the human heart—in love, compassion, and wisdom"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Were still going to tell each other stories. But wouldnt it be revolutionary if, even as we were telling each other stories, we knew that they were only approximations of whats true, at best, while most of our stories dont even approximate the truth very well at all?"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Every time your mind tries to carry you off by telling its stories of why suffering is justified, you can choose to see that its not true. You can begin to see that there really is no justified reason why we should be at war with what is. Theres no way to win this war"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"And yet, even though we believe that we have this power of choice, life keeps showing us that we cant even manipulate where our minds go, that we cant even insist on the way we feel day to day, much less control every one of our behaviors or the behaviors of those around us"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"that once you get through the façade of most human beings, what you find at the core is a feeling that the image they have of themselves is insufficient and not good enough. Its an image that seems in some way wounded—and it can never quite capture the essence of that person"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Its the struggle of trying to be who we wish we were. As soon as we have that kind of division in our minds, we begin to struggle, and as long as were struggling, its very hard for consciousness to shift out of the egoic state, into something more natural, expansive, and whole"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Notice the emotional change happening, and notice what happens when you begin to open your mind just a little bit and invite the possibility—just the possibility—that maybe your conclusions about an event in life, maybe your judgments about it, arent really as true as you think"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"This is an example of how the mind may not be able to figure out how to respond, but how the open and awakened heart can take the lead and offer something beautiful in the moment. This kind of sincerity, this kind of openness and love is, in some measure, where we all need to begin"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,Its an image. Its an idea. A set of thoughts. Its literally a product of imagination. Its who we imagine ourselves to be. We end up putting so much attention onto our image that we remain in a continuous state of protecting or improving our image in order to control how others see us
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Most egos think its important to have control over others, over the environment, and of course over our lives. It seems so obvious that one would want to have some amount of control over their experience. Yet, the irony is, the more you try to control life and others, the more out of control you feel"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"So there is somewhat of a conflict here, because our egos, our minds, the little self that we want to protect—these only exist in time. In fact, they depend on time. Our idea of ourselves, of who and what we are, can only continue in time. We often say to ourselves: Maybe things will be better tomorrow"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"It may be a higher level of delusion than being caught in the egoic state of consciousness, but its a state of delusion nonetheless, because its not complete. Its just the opposite of the egoic state. The formless state of consciousness is just the opposite of that state of consciousness which is identified with form"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"When we see ourself as separate, as something other than the life around us, it breeds a sense of alienation and a sense of fear. Because when we see life as other, when we see each other as other, then these others are seen as potential threats. Of course, life itself is one of the biggest threats that an ego can perceive"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"If were willing to look in a deep way underneath the appearances, what we expect to discover—or perhaps hope to discover—is some great, shining image. Most people, deep in their unconscious, want to find an idea of themselves, an image of themselves, thats really good, quite wonderful, quite worthy of admiration and approval"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Jesus woke up to an innate freedom, and it was that freedom that then allowed life or spirit to flower and express itself in a totally new way. Its this that connects with people in an intuitive way, in an unconscious way. And this is the reason why people have put Jesus on altars and devoted themselves to him through the ages"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"A contraction is simply a narrowing down. When you feel a contraction in your body—whether its in your stomach, your heart, or even in your head—you experience a narrowing down, a squeezing in. When were contracted, were actually pulled out of wholeness, out of a sense of completeness, and into a sense of being small or separate"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"She began to see how thought and feeling work together to create suffering; she saw into how this whole phenomenon of suffering works. Almost always, this deep-seated pain and suffering that stays with us for many years, or even throughout an entire lifetime, are held in place by the unconscious conclusions that we make in the moment"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Jesus is a great example of this. He was someone who really did stand in his own two shoes, as my teacher would say, which means he occupied his own life. He embodied his humanness in such a way that it didnt cause him to be separate; rather, it allowed spirit to occupy his human life in a very awake way. Theres a certain autonomy that comes"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"He called this space of not knowing doing nothing. In this space, theres no doing happening, which means were not leaping back into the mind and starting to do—creating beliefs, ideas, and opinions. To clarify, he emphasized the word doing, rather than the word nothing, to make a point that there is a way that this field of being can actually manifest as action, as doing"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Our sense of self becomes more and more contracted, and more and more solidified and, in a sense, real. And the more real it feels, the more we feel that it needs to be protected, that it needs to get its way. The more real our sense of separateness feels, the more well feel an equal desire to control our environment and to control others so that we make sure we get what we want"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"What are you, really, when you look beyond all images and all ideas about yourself, when you look absolutely directly, right here and right now, when you stand completely within yourself and look underneath the mind, underneath the ideas, underneath the images? Are you willing to enter that space, the place that casts no image, no idea? Are you really willing and ready to be that free and that open?"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"A sense of peace and freedom may be felt at that moment, and it shows you that nothing really needs to change. You dont need to struggle against yourself. Just the opposite. All you need is the willingness to question your minds conclusions, the willingness to just relax. Instead of trying to change now, just let now be as it is, even though your mind may have plenty of reasons why you should resist it"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"There are some people who live with chronic pain for their entire lives. Having talked to some people who experience chronic pain and who have done some deep introspection, I discovered that the people who deal with pain the best do not believe anything they think about their pain. They do not believe the thoughts they have about the future, and they do not indulge in the mind in trying to rationalize the pain"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"As soon as we imagine ourselves to be somebody separate from everyone else, from the life that we see all around us, well naturally have an inner sense that life is something we need to control. In order to stay safe, secure, and separate, we need to control not only ourselves but others, and the circumstances all around us. However, because the truth is that we do not have any control, we inevitably find ourselves in quite a bind"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"What he was telling me, in essence, without really telling me directly, was that my ego, my preferences, played no part in the spiritual life, that he was not going to follow around my egos wants and desires, that our relationship was not going to be based in this. He drew a line in the sand. But as I let go of my ego a bit and started to listen to what he had to say, I then received an intuition and guidance from my inner teacher"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Its the same as being intimate with a view of a sunset, or the leaf on a tree, or the smile in a childs eyes. Its different emotional content, of course—it may be much more intimidating—but really what it means to be intimate with fear is the same as what it means to be intimate with anything else: Instead of running away from it, trying to solve it, making it into your problem, you can actually get very close to it. Getting close doesnt mean you"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"And isnt it odd that even though life shows us over and over again that the ego doesnt have control, we keep believing that it does? We keep insisting that it does, because if it doesnt, that would be too overwhelming! It would seem like the worst thing that an ego could ever realize is that it doesnt have control, because if an ego doesnt have control, then it really has no hope. It has no way out. It has no way to make life into what it wants it to be"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"But when you open yourself to this notion that all your ideas arent true, youre likely to feel quite empty-handed. The mind doesnt know quite what to do. It feels exposed and vulnerable. Its very likely that your mind has never been in this place before, and you might feel the minds compulsive desire to know. Thats okay, because its part of the function of the mind to try to know, to tell stories about the way things are. But the stories will never be as true as the way things really are"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"One of the curious reasons why the ego always brings us back to suffering is that, strangely enough, our ego actually has to be in some resistance to what is. Otherwise, our sense of separation begins to dissolve, we move from our head into our heart and go from a place where we think we know into a very soft space in the heart. From the egoic point of view, its vital that we remain in conflict to some extent, and thats why, when we look at the world around us, we see so much conflict among human beings"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Since the time he lived, weve made Jesus into a projection of what we would hope an awake or God-realized being would be. And in doing so, weve sanitized him from what he seems to actually have been. When we read about the life of Jesus—what he did, how he acted, how he moved through the world of time and space—we see someone who doesnt conform to our conventional ideas of what it means to be awake. Yet, Jesus was an extremely dynamic personality, somebody with great vigor and a real fearlessness to allow spirit to manifest as it wished, which is really what true autonomy is"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"If youve ever been with somebody whos close to physical death and who has also completely let go, you know what a state of freedom this can be. Its such an amazing, paradoxical moment, because there the person is, knowing theyre going to die, and yet they knew it all along. They knew it their whole life. They knew they were going to die, but they didnt really know it until they got some terminal disease, for example, or until the doctor said, Youve got six months to live. For others, the knowledge of death is a certainty: Im not going to make it out of here alive. With most people, however, whether theyve embraced the idea of death all along or not, theres a turn at the very seat of their consciousness when death looms"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"When were truly able to know that whatever we think or say isnt the ultimate truth, then communicating becomes much more of a dance, a play, because we dont have to win or end up being right or correct in our communications. When we realize that what we think and say isnt ultimately the truth, then what we think and say can always adapt itself to the moment. This, in fact, is what wise action is: Activity, speech, and relationship that arises from wisdom and is in harmony with the moment. It is action that changes and molds itself to each and every moment. Each and every moment requires a different response than the last moment. Each conversation requires that you say something different than you did in the last communication"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"I understand that our instinct is to move away from whats not comfortable, to try to get somewhere better, but as my teacher used to say, You need to take the backward step, not the forward step. The forward step is always moving ahead, always trying to attain what you want, whether its a material possession or inner peace. The forward step is very familiar: seeking and more seeking, striving and more striving, always looking for peace, always looking for happiness, looking for love. To take the backward step means to just turn around, reverse the whole process of looking for satisfaction on the outside, and look at precisely the place where you are standing. See if what you are looking for isnt already present in your experience"
2/23/23,Falling into Grace: Insights on the End of Suffering,"Take the following thoughts, for example: imagine a sunny day on the beach, where youre lying in complete relaxation and you can hear the water lapping up against the shore. You can feel the warm sand supporting you from underneath. You can feel the rays of the sun across your face. You can hear the distant bird calls of seagulls. If you just think those thoughts, and allow yourself to really feel them, theyll start to change your consciousness. Youll literally start to feel different about this moment, even though nothing has actually changed, even though youre not actually at the beach. Even though all of it is created in your mind through imagination, it can change the way you feel, and how you feel affects how you perceive yourself, others, and the world around you"

2/12/23,Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart: A Buddhist Perspective on Wholeness,"psychotherapy takes place in the overlap of two areas of playing, that of the patient and that of the therapist.… The corollary of this is that where playing is not possible then the work done by the therapist is directed towards bringing the patient from a state of not being able to play into a state of being able to play"

This led him to withhold his aggression in the sexual arena as well, so that, as a couple, they were never given a chance to transmute anger through passion. Joe did not have faith in his girlfriends love for him. He did not believe that her love could survive his aggression. But he was not giving her a chance"
2/12/23,Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart: A Buddhist Perspective on Wholeness,"In recovering my sadness at the impossibility of my demands, but in not treating that sadness as special, I was learning a lesson that Buddhism teaches over and over again: Uncovering difficult feelings does not make them go away but does enable us to practice tolerance and understanding with the entirety of our being. As Joseph made clear, it is not just the mother that has to be released from perfection. It is everything"
2/12/23,Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart: A Buddhist Perspective on Wholeness,"When plagued with a sense of unworthiness, it is easy to feel deficient and to see the love of another person as the only possible solution to ones plight. Meditation tends to work against this assumption of deficiency by restoring the capacity for connection from the inside. It is like a stealth bomber that sneaks through all the defenses and illuminates the central fortress of the heart. In doing this, it challenges the common assumption of our culture about where connection comes from. In the Buddhist view, connection is already present"
2/12/23,Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart: A Buddhist Perspective on Wholeness,"the most primitive, and taboo, impulses—of sucking, biting, teasing, prohibition, and surrender—can be acted out in the pursuit of union. Just as a child needs her fears held and calmed in her mothers understanding, so too a lover needs her clamor for reunion contained by a passionate response. Passion is a vehicle for containing the incendiary mix of anger and desire. Anger loses its aversive quality and becomes raw excitement. As lovers attack each others boundaries and gradually yield to each others desire, they enter a territory in which the emotions of separateness pulse as one"

They are afraid to face them, but they are plagued by a sense of falseness if they do not, and so they feel stuck. They actually come to therapy not just because they are afraid, but because somewhere within themselves they are searching for a way to go more deeply into those painful places. It is part of our drive for wholeness that we need to connect up with the agonies of the past. The emphasis in Buddhism on acceptance and meditation rather than talking and analyzing is something that Western therapy can learn from"
2/12/23,Going to Pieces Without Falling Apart: A Buddhist Perspective on Wholeness,"Just as a young child needs to be left on her own in the presence of her mother so that she can discover her own vast unknowability, so too we continue to need that freedom to be alone in the midst of our intimacy. It is that continuing unknowability that fuels a relationship. While there can be intense pressure in a couple to override differences and to eliminate separateness, the insistence on complete attunement has a suffocating effect. Attraction is based in otherness and difference as much as it depends on recurrent harmony or satisfaction. Separateness and connection make each other possible; they are not mutually exclusive"

1/31/23,On Becoming a Novelist,"In the writing state—the state of inspiration—the Active dream springs up fully alive: the writer forgets the words he has written on the page and sees, instead, his characters moving around their rooms, hunting through cupboards, glancing irritably through their mail, setting mousetraps, loading pistols"
1/31/23,On Becoming a Novelist,"Such writers are probably wise to do it and get it over with, though theyd be wiser yet to improve their skills and publish somewhere better, for the futures sake.

1/31/23,On Becoming a Novelist,"Some writers, Ive found, make the general assumption that every question asked in an auditorium or a writing class is essentially frivolous, presented in order to draw attention to the asker, or to flatter the visitor and keep things rolling, or simply from mad whim. I try to err in the opposite direction. I assume, in classrooms and auditoriums, as elsewhere, that human beings are smarter and nobler than misanthropic souls imagine. I doubt that anyone whose interest in novel-writing is fake will bother to read this book, and I assume that anyone who cares deeply about writing will forgive me if I say, on any given subject, more than seems necessary, since he will sympathize with my purpose, which is to be useful and thorough"
1/31/23,On Becoming a Novelist,"I write for those who desire, not publication at any cost, but publication one can be proud of—serious, honest fiction, the kind of novel that readers will find they enjoy reading more than once, the kind of fiction likely to survive. Fine workmanship—art that avoids cheap and easy effects, takes no shortcuts, struggles never to lie even about the most trifling matters (such as which object, precisely, an angry man might pick up to throw at his kitchen wall, or whether a given character would in fact say you arent or the faintly more assertive youre not)—workmanship, in short, that impresses us partly by its painstaking care, gives pleasure and a sense of lifes worth and dignity not only to the reader but to the writer as well. This book is for the beginning novelist who has already figured out that it is far more satisfying to write well than simply to write well enough to get published"
1/31/23,On Becoming a Novelist,"On the other hand, the writer who avoids writers workshops (or some other solid community of writers) is probably in for trouble. One can be fooled by the legend of, say, Jack London, and imagine that the best way to become a writer is to be a seaman or lumberjack. Jack London lived in an age when writers were folk heroes, as they are not now, and an age when technique was not quite as important as it is now. Though a tragic and noble man, he was a relatively bad writer. He could have used a few good teachers. Hemingway once remarked that the best way to become a writer is to go off and write. But his own way of doing it was to go to Paris, where many of the great writers were, and to study with the greatest theorist of the time, and one of the shrewdest writers, Gertrude Stein. Joseph Conrad, though we tend to think of him as a solitary genius, worked in close community with Ford Maddox Ford, H. G. Wells, Henry James, and Stephen Crane, among others. Melville had Hawthorne and his circle. Great writers are almost always associated with a literary dynasty. Its hard to find an exception. (Incredibly, even Malcolm Lowry was part of a group.) So for psychological reasons, if for no other, even a bad workshop may be better than none"

It had previously been argued (in chapter 4) that to perform an invariant order encoded by other than the performer constitutes an acceptance by the performer of that order. Although such acceptance does not necessarily signify belief in the contents of that order, nor guarantee actions conforming to it, it does establish an obligation to abide by it, and an agreement to have one's actions judged by it. In chapter 9 I further proposed that such acceptance is tantamount to agreement not to question that order or the Ultimate Sacred Postulate it expresses.

1/13/23,Essays in Zen Buddhism: First Series,"We are thus made to live on the superficiality of things. We may be clever, bright, and all that, but what we produce lacks depth, sincerity, and does not appeal to the inmost feelings.

1/13/23,Essays in Zen Buddhism: First Series,"But when it comes to the question of life itself we cannot wait for the ultimate solution to be offered by the intellect, even if it could do so. We cannot suspend even for a moment our life-activity for philosophy to unravel its mysteries. Let the mysteries remain as they are, but live we must. The hungry cannot wait until a complete analysis of food is obtained and the nourishing value of each element is determined. For the dead the scientific knowledge of food will be of no use whatever.

There is no Away on this surface, no here and no there. In effect, the entire Earth is a wadded tissue of vomited milk"
12/28/22,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),"Hypocrisy results from the conditions of the impossibility of a metalanguage (and as I shall explain, we are now freshly aware of these conditions because of the ecological emergency); weakness from the gap between phenomenon and thing, which the hyperobject makes disturbingly visible; and lameness from the fact that all entities are fragile (as a condition of possibility for their existence), and hyperobjects make this fragility conspicuous"

She learns to distinguish between the vomit and the not-vomit, and comes to know the not-vomit as self.12 Every subject is formed at the expense of some viscous, slightly poisoned substance, possibly teeming with bacteria, rank with stomach acid. The parent scoops up the mucky milk in a tissue and flushes the wadded package down the toilet. Now we know where it goes. For some time we may have thought that the U-bend in the toilet was a convenient curvature of ontological space that took whatever we flush down it into a totally different dimension called Away"
12/28/22,Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World (Posthumanities Book 27),"Some days, global warming fails to heat me up. It is strangely cool or violently stormy. My intimate sensation of prickling heat at the back of my neck is only a distorted print of the hot hand of global warming. I do not feel at home in the biosphere. Yet it surrounds me and penetrates me, like the Force in Star Wars. The more I know about global warming, the more I realize how pervasive it is. The more I discover about evolution, the more I realize how my entire physical being is caught in its meshwork. Immediate, intimate symptoms of hyperobjects are vivid and often painful, yet they carry with them a trace of unreality"

The formed in him dissolves and binds itself anew with the children of chaos, the powers of darkness, the ruling and the seducing, the compelling and the alluring, the divine and the devilish"

He sees badly who wants to see; you have overreached yourself. I: It is true, I eagerly longed to reach you, to hear more. Salome startled me and led me into bewilderment. I felt dizzy, because what she said seemed to me to be monstrous and like madness. Where is Salome? E: How impetuous you are! What is up with you? Step over to the crystal and prepare yourself in its light"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"Nobody can spare themselves the waiting and most will be unable to bear this torment, but will throw themselves with greed back at men, things, and thoughts, whose slaves they will become from then on. Since then it will have been clearly proved that this man is incapable of enduring beyond things, men, and thoughts, and they will hence become his master and he will become their fool, since he cannot be without them, not until even his soul has become a fruitful field"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"In that night my life was threatened since I had to kill my lord and God, not in single combat, since who among mortals could kill a God in a duel? You can reach your God only as an assassin,120 if you want to overcome him. But this is the bitterest for mortal men: our Gods want to be overcome, since they require renewal. If men kill their princes, they do so because they cannot kill their Gods, and because they do not know that they should kill their Gods in themselves"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"But pleasure immediately attracts everything you desire, and then you must decide whether your pleasure spoils or enhances you. If you are of the devil, you will grope in blind desire after the manifold, and it will lead you astray. But if you remain with yourself, as a man who is himself and not of the devil, then you will remember your humanity. You will not behave toward women per se as a man, but as a human being, that is to say, as if you were of the same sex as her. You will recall your femininity"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),This work of understanding encompasses a number of interlinked threads: an attempt to understand himself and to integrate and develop the various components of his personality; an attempt to understand the structure of the human personality in general; an attempt to understand the relation of the individual to present-day society and to the community of the dead; an attempt to understand the psychological and historical effects of Christianity; and an attempt to grasp the future religious development of the
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"When I saw that the devil is joy, surely I would have wanted to make a pact with him. But you can make no pact with joy, because it immediately disappears. Therefore you cannot capture the devil either. Yes, it belongs to his essence that he cannot be captured. He is stupid if he lets himself be caught, and you gain nothing from having yet one more stupid devil. The devil always seeks to saw off the branch on which you sit. That is useful and protects you from falling asleep and from the vices that go along with it"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"I loved the beauty of the beautiful, the spirit of those rich in spirit, the strength of the strong; I laughed at the stupidity of the stupid, I despised the weakness of the weak, the meanness of the mean, and hated the badness of the bad. But now I must love the beauty of the ugly, the spirit of the foolish, and the strength of the weak. I must admire the stupidity of the clever, must respect the weakness of the strong and the meanness of the generous, and honor the goodness of the bad. Where does that leave mockery, contempt, and hatred?"

Yes, its really remarkable, the things that people can do. And thats what this fellow calls mental stimulation! But wait—that does seem remarkable: didnt the saints also carry their heads under their arms?36 Didnt Saint Francis and Saint Ignatius levitate—and what about the three men in the fiery furnace?37 Isnt it a blasphemous idea to consider the Acta Sanctorum as historical cinema?38 Oh, todays miracles are simply somewhat less mythical than technical"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"NO. 2 pursued religious reflections in solitude, in a state of communion with nature and the cosmos. He inhabited Gods world. This personality felt most real. Personality NO. 1 wanted to be free of the melancholy and isolation of personality NO. 2. When personality NO. 2 entered, it felt as if a long dead yet perpetually present spirit had entered the room. NO. 2 had no definable character. He was connected to history, particularly with the Middle Ages. For NO. 2, NO. 1, with his failings and ineptitudes, was someone to be put up with. This interplay ran throughout Jungs life"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"The first possibility of making use of them is artistic, if one is in any way gifted in that direction; a second is philosophical speculation; a third is quasi-religious, leading to heresy and the founding of sects; and a fourth way of employing the dynamis of these images is to squander it in every form of licentiousness.174 From this perspective, the psychological utilization of these images would represent a fifth way. For it to succeed, psychology had to distinguish itself clearly from art, philosophy, and religion. This necessity accounts for Jungs rejection of the alternatives"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"Life wants to jump over such barriers and you will fall out with yourself. These barriers are not your real limits, but arbitrary limitations that do unnecessary violence to you. Therefore try to find your real limits. One never knows them in advance, but one sees and understands them only when one reaches them. And this happens to you only if you have balance. Without balance you transgress your limits without noticing what has happened to you. You achieve balance, however, only if you nurture your opposite. But that is hateful to you in your innermost core, because it is not heroic"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"Jung discusses many other themes in the work, including the nature of self-knowledge; the nature of the soul; the relations of thinking and feeling and the psychological types; the relation of inner and outer masculinity and femininity; the uniting of opposites; solitude; the value of scholarship and learning; the status of science; the significance of symbols and how they are to be understood; the meaning of the war; madness, divine madness, and psychiatry; how the Imitation of Christ is to be understood today; the death of God; the historical significance of Nietzsche; and the relation of magic and reason"
12/21/22,The Red Book: A Reader&#39;s Edition (Philemon),"Yet that joy is the devil, or that the devil is joy, has got to worry you. I pondered this for over a week, and I fear that it has not been enough. You dispute the fact that your joy is your devil. But it seems as if there is always something devilish about joy. If your joy is no devil for you, then possibly it is for your neighbors, since joy is the most supreme flowering and greening of life. This knocks you down, and you must grope for a new path, since the light in that joyful fire has completely gone out for you. Or your joy tears your neighbor away and throws him off course, since life is like a great fire that torches everything in its vicinity. But fire is the element of the devil"

I dont know if this is art, I said to myself. I dont know what this is, or what art is. Id always thought of art as something that was expressed through certain tools: painting, sculpture, photography, writing, film, music, architecture. And yes, performance. But this performance went beyond performance. This was life. Could art, should art, be isolated from life? I began to feel more and more strongly that art must be life—it must belong to everybody.

After a big failure, I go into a deep depression and a very dark part of my body, but soon afterward I come back to life again, alive to something else. I always question artists who are successful in whatever they do—I think what that means is that theyre repeating themselves and not taking enough risks. If you experiment, you have to fail. By definition, experimenting means going to territory where youve never been, where failure is very possible. How can you know youre going to succeed?

12/11/22,Semiotics: The Basics,A sign is a recognizable combination of a signifier with a particular signified. The same signifier (the word open) could stand for a different signified (and thus be a different sign) if it were on a push-button inside a lift (push to open door)

11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),"Again, Ader makes a scene; he stages a moment of crisis to trigger primary emotional responses"
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),But how can a reality prove the miraculous when it lies in the nature of the miraculous to point beyond reality?
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),"evocation of an entire genre: the world of stories, songs, films and fashion that surround the motif of the sailor as romantic hero"
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),"Historically, the project of romanticism could be understood as the development of a radical sense of selfhood through the cultivation of intense feelings"
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),Ader puts the idea of the romantic quest to the test in order to see what it is worth and to experience what it feels like to act out an un-contemporary idea
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),"moves freely between the general idea and the specific experience of the romantic quest, and avoid suffocating the work under the heavy cloak of heroic authenticity"
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),It acknowledges grief as an existential fact the interpretation of which must remain inconclusive. But it gives a right and a form to that grief. And maybe this is as far as you can go
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),"What further serves to frame these themes as genre motifs and create a certain distance towards them is Aders conceptual choice to select motifs and media that are, if not openly nostalgic, at least decidedly uncontemporary"
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),"It is, after all, one of the merits of Aders work that it disentangles the concept of the romantic act from its coercive ties to a belief system, and thereby makes it possible to reconsider the idea, intellectually as well as emotionally"
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),"This attitude manifests itself, for instance, in the melancholic humour with which Ader traces the romantic sublime in the banalities of the Coasters lyrics, and thereby proves that the sublime and the banal are today each others flipside"
11/26/22,Bas Jan Ader: In Search of the Miraculous (Afterall Books / One Work),"Therefore, to speak about the work as if nothing happened and to treat it simply as a conceptual piece would mean to betray the existential loss it entailed. However, to portray it solely as a work sealed by the artists death and therefore to disregard its speculative conceptual dimension would equally do neither the work nor Ader himself justice"

11/12/22,Turning Pro,"Turning pro is like kicking a drug habit or stopping drinking. It's a decision, a decision to which we must re-commit every day"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"Because the amateur owns nothing of spirit in the present, she either looks forward to a hopeful future or backward to an idyllic past"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"Resistance hates two qualities above all others: concentration and depth. Why? Because when we work with focus and we work deep, we succeed"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"When we truly understand that the tribe doesn't give a damn, we're free. There is no tribe, and there never was. Our lives are entirely up to us"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"The professional may seek instruction or wisdom from one who is further along in mastery than he, but he does so without surrendering his self-sovereignty"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"When we were amateurs, our life was about drama, about denial, and about distraction. Our days were simultaneously full to the bursting point and achingly, heartbreakingly empty"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"Distraction and displacement seem innocent on the surface. How can we be harming ourselves by having fun, or seeking romance, or enjoying the fruits of this big, beautiful world?"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,The repetitive nature of the shadow life and of addiction is what makes both so tedious. No traction is ever gained. No progress is made. We're stuck in the same endlessly-repeating loop
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"They will try to entice us to get stoned with them or fuck off with them or waste time with them, as we've done in the past, and when we refuse, they will turn against us and talk us down behind our backs"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"Each day, the professional understands, he will wake up facing the same demons, the same Resistance, the same self-sabotage, the same tendencies to shadow activities and amateurism that he has always faced"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"The amateur is a narcissist. He views the world hierarchically. He continuously rates himself in relation to others, becoming self-inflated if his fortunes rise, and desperately anxious if his star should fall"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"Fear is the primary color of the amateur's interior world. Fear of failure, fear of success, fear of looking foolish, fear of under-achieving and fear of over-achieving, fear of poverty, fear of loneliness, fear of death"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"Do you understand? I hadn't written anything good. It might be years before I would, if I ever did at all. That didn't matter. What counted was that I had, after years of running from it, actually sat down and done my work"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"A horse that loves to run will beat a horse that's compelled, every day of the week. I want my horses to love the track. I want my exercise riders to have to hold them back in the morning because they're so excited to get out and run"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"Because the amateur is so powerfully identified with herself, she finds it extremely difficult to view the world through the eyes of others. The amateur is often unkind or insensitive to others, but she saves her most exquisite cruelty for herself"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"Be brave, my heart [wrote the poet and mercenary, Archilochus]. Plant your feet and square your shoulders to the enemy. Meet him among the man-killing spears. Hold your ground. When we turn pro, we stop running from our fears. We turn around and face them"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"THE AMATEUR SEEKS PERMISSION The amateur believes that, before she can act, she must receive permission from some Omnipotent Other — a lover or spouse, a parent, a boss, a figure of authority. The amateur sits on a stool, like Lana Turner at Schwab's, waiting to be discovered"
11/12/22,Turning Pro,"The amateur is young and dumb. He's innocent, he's good-hearted, he's well-intentioned. The amateur is brave. He's inventive and resourceful. He's willing to take a chance. Like Luke Skywalker, the amateur harbors noble aspirations. He has dreams. He seeks liberation and enlightenment. And he's willing, he hopes, to pay the price"

8/22/22,A Prayer Journal,I must write down that I am to be an artist. Not in the sense of aesthetic frippery but in the sense of aesthetic craftsmanship; otherwise I will feel my loneliness continually—like this today. The word craftsmanship takes care of the work angle & the word aesthetic the truth angle
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"In death, he is with the times, so much so that his art radiates"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,Aders death occurred during this transformation is an element of chance
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,part of individual artists to construct their identity through the media
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,There was nothing substantial that linked the trip to art besides his presence
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Up until his sail, he had never achieved his goal, never reached a point where"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"The utter intensity of Aders practice, his Sisyphean search for concrete truths"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,an idea or experience could exist perfectly. In every instance some form of mediation interfered
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"exhibitions as communal meals, cooking traditional Thai dishes for all who attended his openings"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"It is these images, often shown in institutions, that have helped these acts be considered as art"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"If Western metaphysics exists in language, the medium of the discourse is without link to being as such"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"In the end, the piece hinged less on Burdens hardship and more upon what viewers believed they were encountering: presence or absence"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"He submitted to the logic of the piece, a claustrophobic captivity in which he could do nothing except wait for the allotted time to pass"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,at the time of Aders sail the artist was considered supplemental to the representation. It was the work of art and not its creator that was given emphasis
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,It was in the moment of death that Ader encountered his absolute truth. Nothing is as unmediated as the end of life. It is the only event one faces absolutely alone
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Burdens situation is different from that of LeWitt or other conceptual artists because his primary medium is himself, not a concept or something pointing back toward an idea"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"To a certain extent this is true, but for performances to be considered art an institutional framework had to be enlisted to wall off the artistic act from everyday gestures"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Such is the appeal of a great deal of conceptual art. It gives viewers access to a sliver of life that by its association to radical art seems progressive, ideal, even utopian"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,What further enhances this point is the role of documentation. Seemingly incidental photographs—often in black and white—form much of the visual history of conceptual and performance art
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Derrida doubts the isolation of specific words and phrases and suggests that spoken language is never cut off from its chain of signification, nor is it the creation of a single individual"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Shoot was Burdens way to know pain intimately, yet what is most disturbing about it is the involvement of an audience and a shooter in a situation that is a by-product of Burdens abdication of will"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Manry, it seems, searched for the transcendent, and he described his voyage aboard Tinkerbelle as a means to discover truth, as giving him a way to express life the way an artist does with paint on canvas"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"level. Derrida observes, in the broad tradition of Western thought, a lack of criticality toward communication. For him, a central issue is how writing, the primary medium of philosophy, supplements speech"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"But what perhaps caught Aders attention more than anything was Manrys utter ordinariness. He was in appearance and lifestyle an unspectacular individual, a solid and upstanding citizen who dutifully got along"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"But to think of the piece as complete—made such by events known only to Ader—allows one to understand it as offering a reorientation of the conception of an artwork, how it is constituted, and how it communicates"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"What was to make Aders upcoming sail unique was its absolute singularity. It had the potential to be an experience that defied representation. To emphasize that point, to in essence portray that which cannot be represented, Aders Copley show had to be extravagant. It had to make explicit the relation between absence and presence"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Copley was surprised by the shows content. The installation seemed quite removed from the person who appeared to be turning inward and growing more detached from those around him. For Copley, the exhibition was a spectacle, a particularly apt description of a project that at its core was about the relation between presence and absence"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"The central appeal of the voyage was that it could not be captured adequately in words or images. Ader could depict it, of course; he could explain in great detail the daily travails of his crossing. But neither effort would close the representational gap his voyage inherently entailed. The beauty and truth of Aders sail was for him alone"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"something that spoke to his own doubts about his practice and the efficacy of his art, to his desires to become someone else, to shift roles and lifestyles, to his imagined self-image as an artist who wore a tie while driving a Mercedes, someone who made it seem to others that he would simply cease to be an artist and become a regular person"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"he thought making art was about living ones life, a sentiment she attributed to the time he spent with his friend James Turrell. Ader seemed caught up in the idea of having a double identity and was becoming increasingly strange, ever more drawn to secret lives. She felt that, by the time of the exhibition, his desire to be an artist had waned. It was as if he no longer cared"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Something happened, but it remains forever unknown, enabling the work to ask if life can communicate without a context, without a representational system. It is a question that asks if Ader can simply be, and by so doing have some efficacy, some ability to evoke compassion or feeling from others. The eventual reception of Aders art suggests that under the right conditions it can"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Aders sail was not a performance. There was nothing staged, something Goldstein, even many years after the fact, could not comprehend: The difference between Bas Jan and me is that I wouldnt have to take that boat trip; a flyer would have been enough. He came out of a time when the artist had to be involved in making a piece; he physically had to make the journey, while I would have treated it as pure theater, so a publication would have been enough"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"The distinction between such projects by Burden, Goldstein, and Ruppersberg and Aders is obvious: Aders peers mostly made representations; In Search of the Miraculous was something else. Aders body was never found, and three years after Ocean Wave was recovered he was legally declared lost at sea. It is impossible to know what happened to him. No records survive that could shed light on the tragic event; the camera and tape recorder he took with him disappeared as well"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"He makes an initial choice as to the constitution of his piece, and from that point forward fate runs its course. To a certain degree, what Burden describes is akin to the way Sol LeWitt devised instructions for wall drawings, which assistants would execute following the logic of his directions. There are many other instances of what might be considered an elision of subjectivity, where authorial voice—for example, that of Lawrence Weiner or On Kawara—was obviated by rule-based systems that depersonalized the work of art"
8/17/22,Bas Jan Ader: Death Is Elsewhere,"Condillac argues that writing forges an insoluble link between the text and an author who is no longer present once the act of reading commences. The authenticity of the original thought continues without modification in the written document. Derrida finds flaws in this formulation, especially when considering the mechanisms that underpin written communication. He contends that for a written statement to function it must be able to communicate without recourse to the authors presence. Yet this is just half of the equation, since Derrida is also wary of written communication that may be understood only by the addresser and the intended addressee. A situation such as this demands a specific addressee, and the lack of his or her presence invariably makes the writing unintelligible. Writing, as Derrida describes, has always operated independently, for if it is to communicate, it must be able to function in spite of those who write and read. This is how it signifies in the moment as well as in the future. This also means that what writing represents is contingent, that the written text is not a direct conduit to presence, that in its state of signification it is the thing itself"

8/4/22,Native Speaker,"She was always surging ahead of where we were, never staying with one notion for too long, and I willingly followed her wherever she needed to go, off the real subject, maybe pushed her there myself"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Luck, like most everything else, must be a Chinese invention. We Koreans have reinvented the idea of luck as mostly bad, and try to do everything we can to prevent it. We fear leaving anything to chance"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"That woman? She has been hurting me! Do you know that? She and that dog Jenkins would have me bow down before every cheat and beggar in this city. Who is left? You? Should I get on my knees to you, too?"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I can see that he is hurt, the instant hang in his expression. How his American life shows through so clearly. Another Korean man of his generation would not forgive the moment so quickly, if ever at all"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Luckily, the school officials we check in with dont seem to care. They greet her and then look at me and dont ask questions. They can figure I am part of her materials, the days curriculum. Show and tell"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Lelia had great trouble accepting this stunning ignorance of mine. That summer, when it seemed she was thinking about it, she would stare in wonderment at me as if I had a gaping hole blown through my head"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"The men Ive been with have this idea to make me over. I feel like a rock in some boys polishing kit. I go in dull, scratched up, and then rumble rumble whirr, Im supposed to come out precious and sparkling again"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"That I no longer can simply flash a light inside a character, paint a figure like Kwang with a momentary language, but that I know the greater truths reside in our necessary fictions spanning human event and time?"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"He possessed a certain grace with the glass in his hand, the way hed hold himself with it thrust toward the ocean like one mans saving beacon, the dying yellow light hitting it from behind him and sparking the amber"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"And where he began to think of America as a part of him, maybe even his, and this for me was the crucial leap of his character, deep flaw or not, the leap of his identity no one in our work would find valuable but me"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"My self-conception was that I was frail. I would sometimes affect similar ailments to my mothers and try to mimic her, stay in my room whole weekends with a pile of picture books or puzzles, never changing out of my pajamas"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"When you are someone like me, you will be many people all at once. You are a father, a dictator, a servant, the most agile actor this land has ever known. And all throughout you must be the favorite chaste love of the people"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"But I dont, I say. Ive forgotten how, if I ever knew. Then, when someone like Kwang attempts anything larger, theres instant suspicion. Someone must step up and pay to send in us hyenas. Well sniff him out. We eat our own, you know"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I wouldnt eat or sleep at a friends house if it werent prearranged. I never assumed anyone would be generous to me, or in any way helpful. I never considered it my right to expect approval or sanction no matter what good I had done"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I found the coin in the back flap pocket of his shorts. The coin was warm—the bag must have been left near a window—and I wondered how long the shiny metal could hold in a heat, if it could remember something like the press of flesh"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Now, keep thinking. Think for keeps. Then, isolate the wonderments, the curiosities of his death; they will help you to see. Shed sentimentality. Stop this falling in love with fate. Reside, if you can, in the last place of the dead"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"George Washington Park. He was practicing the writing of his signature. And then, the woman begins to shift her consciousness from the dead father to the absent son, her husband. Is it the coldness of objects, she wonders, that persists?"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Later, to tell him something else, Id place a larger bouquet than his on my mothers grave. I drove only used, beat-up cars. I never asked him for his money. I spoke volumes to him this way, speak to him still, those same volumes he spoke with me"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Maybe this. This. Why you find yourself here in this silly room with a man like me, rather than at home in bed with your beautiful wife. Why you are one of us. I look at you and see someone who could have done whatever he wished in life. Any career"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I nodded, looking away from her. Then she reached for my cheek, her cool fingertips on my skin. I leaned into them. I took her hand and held it to my face, against my mouth. At that moment I almost wished for something like smothering myself with her"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"You were solemn and dignified. Remember? Thats who you were for about a year. The bowing, the white-glove bit. Youre the one who calmly explained to everyone how well we were doing. Of course I was the mad and stupid one. The crazy white lady in the attic"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Later, after he died, Id try it again, ride the train with Lelia to the same restaurant and store, but in the end we would separately wander the aisles not looking for anything, except at the last moment, when we finally encountered each other, who was not him"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,You were well raised. You have a keen sense of accommodation. This is clear. You understand respect and distance and separateness. Fine things. But someplace in your life you let them go too far. Too far for any more good to come of them. The result is foregone
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I will not rid my expression of the sudden worry and weight. I will not hush or so handle my heart. I will put my hand in her hair. Kiss her ear. Now whisper a speech with my smallest voice. She whispers back, this blessing we share. Now I think we will both dream of fire"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I asked her not to make a scene of it, and I could see that she was about to shout out but then just as quickly she quelled herself—a trick perhaps that she had gleaned from me—and whispered sharply that if I wanted to wait I had better be willing to talk about adoption again"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I think I can bear silence from anyone but him. I want him to stand up and show his face and say something for Eduardo. And for a moment I feel that hot ore of my fathers rage, what would sometimes drive him like disease or madness to hack like a demon at wet sod in the backyard"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"For the first few assignments you feel perfectly transparent, as if the man or woman in question can witness every leap of your heart. You think they can sense every false move. But in successive turns you grow an opacity, a pearl-like glow whose surface can repel all manner of heat and light"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I remember how I sat with him in those restaurants, both of us eating without savor, unjoyous, and my wanting to show him that I could be as steely as he, my chin as rigid and unquivering as any of his displays, that I would tolerate no mysteries either, no shadowy wounds or scars of the heart"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Instantly I was thinking of the lover she might want, the man whom shed searched out but hadnt yet found in her life. I thought of the ways Nils was perhaps falling short. I put myself in her place and imagined her father and mother. Boyfriends, recent loves. I made those phantom calculations, did all that"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Theres nothing you have to say. I just wonder, thats all. This woman has given twenty years of her life to you and your father and it still seems like she could be anyone to you. It doesnt seem to matter who she is. Right? If your father switched her now with someone else, probably nothing would be different"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"His practice was healthy, built up now for many years, and I could tell it was all adding up to the prime of his life, that noble time, a period that my father seemed to squeeze down to a few scant minutes around midnight, sitting with a beer in front of his projection TV, absently chuckling at wrestlers and clowns"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"What you really want from me. I dont know what you need in life. For example, do you need your job? Im not understanding what you mean by need. See what I mean? she shouted. You know, I really honestly thought about it for the first time in Corsica, I mean really thought about what you do up there with your friends"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Thats much better, you! Why not yell at me? Ill allow it. Dont think of me as elder; come, strike out at me with your words, or something else. This is America, we can do this. Say it in English if you have to. Get it out in the open. You want this. I am not your father. I am not your friend. Come on, I will survive"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"His parents came from a slum in Athens, no place near those magnificent columns of chalky rock, and I could imagine that his mother and father were just like him, thick-fingered people of the earth, human weeds, hardened and sad and always ready to burst from the drab husks of their lives with great quaking fits of emotion"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Right. Anyway, I dont care what they look like. No offense. I thought about it and I dont really give a damn if they look like a goddamn UNICEF poster, though I think theyll probably be damn nice to look at. You two think about it. A little baby granddaughter, or grandson. Anyhow, just make some babies, for the old folks. Make some babies for us"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I used to wish that I were more like my Jewish and Italian friends, or even the black kids who hung out in front of my fathers stores; I was envious of how theyd speak so confidently, so jubilantly celebrate the fact with their hands and hips and tongues, letting it all hang out (though of course in different ways) for anybody whod look and listen"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"When real trouble hits, I lock up. I cant work the trusty calculus. I cant speak. I sit there, unmoved. For a person like Lelia, who grew up with hollerers and criers, mine is the worst response. It must look as if Im not even trying. Unless I drink too much Ill eventually recede. I go into my fathers act, though she only knows this from what Ive told her"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I listened to the tapes tonight, I said, trying not to sound sentimental. I decided to wander over. I bet, she said, crossing her arms. Though I doubt youve ever really wandered. I wander a lot. Oh, thats good, she replied. But only in the place and time of your choosing. The word for that is invasion. So shoot me. She cocked her thumb and aimed right between my eyes. Pow"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"In profile, you saw the same blunt line descend the back of their necks, those high, flat ears, but then little else because Lelia—or maybe her father—had endowed Mitt with that other, potent sprawl of limbs, those round, vigilant eyes, the upturned ancestral nose (like a scriveners, in my imagination), his boys form already so beautifully jumbled and subversive and historic"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"And sometimes I will write them out now, again, though for myself, those old strokes, unofficial versions of any newcomer I see in the street or on the bus or in the demi-shops of the city, the need in me still to undo the cipherlike faces scrawled with hard work, and no work, and all trouble. The faces of my father and his workers, and Ahjuhma, and the ever-dimming one of my mother"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"But I can imagine my father saying his no, no, it was clearly Kwangs Confucian training at work, his secular religion of pure hierarchy, his belief that everyone is at once a noble and a servant and then just a man. Its adherents know no hubris. Instead this: you simply bow down before those who would honor you. You honor them back. For you are but ash to their fire. All spent of light"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"He was how I imagined a Korean would be, at least one living in any renown. He would stride the daises and the stages with his voice strong and clear, unafraid to speak the language like a Puritan and like a Chinaman and like every boat person in between. I found him most moving and beautiful in those moments. And whenever I hear the strains of a different English, I will still shatter a little inside"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"We will learn every lesson of accent and idiom, we will dismantle every last pretense and practice you hold, noble as well as ruinous. You can keep nothing safe from our eyes and ears. This is your own history. We are your most perilous and dutiful brethren, the song of our hearts at once furious and sad. For only you could grant me these lyrical modes. I call them back to you. Here is the sole talent I ever dared nurture"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"He has sung whole love songs to the cynical crowds, told tall stories of courage and honor, doing all this without any mythic display, without savvy, almost embarrassing the urban throng. They would look up at him from their seats and see he was serious and then quietly make certain to themselves that this was still the country they grew up in. They had never imagined a man like him, an American like him. But no one ever left"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"He could pass for twenty-four. Hes pleasant of face, not so much handsome as he is gentle-looking, and pink of cheek; he only shaves in spots. His gait is casual and patient and straight. Hes not looking at anything in particular, his gaze too fair. Too fair all around, as though he couldnt offend anybody. So he looks friendly, he looks like hed be willing to talk to you, but really because of the way his gaze circles about you"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Americans, one of them would say, are a wonderful and exuberant people. They dance, they play-fight, they puff up their lips and blow out their chests. They enjoy using their hands. They seem to live always at a football match. They stand in broken columns and flurry with both arms and both legs and they are not afraid to make a mess of themselves. They dont so much sing as they do chant. Chanting is more satisfying, at least how they do"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"So I hung up, she said. I havent spoken to him since before that. I never understood how he could just drop me like that. Is it a Korean thing? I mean, what kind of person does that? Except for the very end, everything was great between us. We had great sex, too, and that doesnt happen a lot in college. But now I have to think none of it was very good. It was like hed done his time with me, with a white girl, and then it was over. I almost still hate him. Asshole"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Its like the most awful and sad opera, the strong music of his English, then her black English; her colorful, almost elevated, mocking of him, and his grim explosions. They fight like lovers, scarred, knowing. Their song circular and vicious. For she always comes back the next day, and so does he. Its like they are here to torture each other. He cant afford a store anywhere else but where she lives, and she has no other place to buy a good apple or a fresh loaf of bread"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"My father was obviously not modern, in the psychological sense. He was still mostly unencumbered by those needling questions of existence and self-consciousness. Irony was always lost on him. He was the definition of a thick skin. For most of my youth I wasnt sure that he had the capacity to love. He showed great respect to my mother to the day she died—I was ten—and practiced for her the deepest sense of duty and honor, but I never witnessed from him a devotion I could call love"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"And yet you may know me. I am an amiable man. I can be most personable, if not charming, and whatever I possess in this life is more or less the result of a talent I have for making you feel good about yourself when you are with me. In this sense I am not a seducer. I am hardly seen. I wont speak untruths to you, I wont pass easy compliments or odious offerings of flattery. I make do with on-hand materials, what I can chip out of you, your natural ore. Then I fuel the fire of your most secret vanity"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I tried to answer but I couldnt. I wanted to explain myself, smartly, irrefutably. But once again I had nothing to offer. I had always thought that I could be anyone, perhaps several anyones at once. Dennis Hoagland and his private firm had conveniently appeared at the right time, offering the perfect vocation for the person I was, someone who could reside in his one place and take half-steps out whenever he wished. For that I felt indebted to him for life. I found a sanction from our work, for I thought I had finally found my truest place in the culture"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I compared these to some of the other moments that I remembered her saying it, the night we decided to live together, the morning after Mitt was born, the time drunk in a bar when she thought I had been sleeping with another woman. I never felt comfortable with the phrase, had a deep trouble with it, all the ways it was said. You could say it in a celebratory sense. For corroboration. In gratitude. To get a point across, to instill guilt in your lover, to defend yourself. You said it after great deliberation, or when you felt reckless. You said it when you meant it and sometimes when you didnt. You somehow always said it when you had to"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"What threw me most, however, was that he would sometimes misremember whether I had children—this seems improbable, given what I would learn about his amazing feats of memory—and while talking about child rearing he might refer to how I must know this thing or that, the way a child can be joyous and harrowing, ask of what I imagined in life for my daughter or my son. When he over-drank he wanted to see pictures. I had to tell him I didnt carry any. He would open his wallet and show me snapshots of his own children, Peter and John Jr., in matching blue suits. He also carried a picture of May, though it dated to the sixties (her hair, her dress) and was nearly faded of all color"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Now, as the first front door opened, I spoke calmly and severely, explaining the situation as one of gravity but not crisis. But then, at the sight of the offending boy, the old man behind me inexplicably exploded, chopping the air with his worn fingers, cursing red-faced like a cheated peasant in our throaty mother tongue until the bewildered child began to cry. His mother protested meekly (you could tell she knew my father) and I, too, wanted him to stop yelling, to shut up and let me speak. Instead I allowed myself to sacrifice this boy and his mother, perhaps even myself, and let the old man yell this one bloody murder, if only for Mitt. I know this: a child doesnt forgive or forget—he works it out"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I remember thinking of her, Whats she afraid of, what could be so bad that we had to be that careful of what people thought of us, as if we ought to mince delicately about in pained feet through our immaculate neighborhood, we silent partners of the bordering WASPs and Jews, never rubbing them except with a smile, as if everything with us were always all right, in our great sham of propriety, as if nothing could touch us or wreak anger or sadness upon us. That we believed in anything American, in impressing Americans, in making money, polishing apples in the dead of night, perfectly pressed pants, perfect credit, being perfect, shooting black people, watching our stores and offices burn down to the ground"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"We lay down together but we werent touching. Her eyes were closed, though just barely, the lids frail and milky and almost transparent in the dim light. The heat of her face, her throat, drew me closer to her and the tiny hairs on my cheeks and brow tingled from the nearness. For it was nearness and not touch that had always compelled me. I have only known proximity. She didnt move away. I didnt try to touch her. I knew I shouldnt. I just closed my eyes, and I slid to her until I could feel the warmth of my own face play back against hers, the reflection like an instant map of heat. I thought I could read every contour of her skin and bone, every relief of her flesh. What it all said. As if I could ever read her mind"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Its my brand of sloth, surely, that I could fail my wife so miserably but seem to provide all the necessary objects and affections. On paper, by any known standard, I was an impeccable mate. I did everything well enough. I cooked well enough, cleaned enough, was romantic and sensitive and silly enough, I made love enough, was paternal, big brotherly, just a good friend enough, father-to-my-son enough, forlorn enough, and then even bull-headed and dull and macho enough, to make it all seamless. For ten years she hadnt realized the breadth of what I had accomplished with my exacting competence, the daily work I did, which unto itself became an unassailable body of cover. And the surest testament to the magnificent and horrifying level of my virtuosity was that neither had I"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Say, Lelia tells me your father is a fine businessman. Absolute best, I said, taking a long sip. He had to be, he replied. No one was going to help him if he failed. I wish I had spoken to him more at the wedding. I saw a man who didnt have to make a display of himself. You knew he walked every inch to where he is. He owes no one, and he cant conceive of being owed something. Thats the problem with us right now, its that we have a country here of people, both rich and poor, who think theyre entitled to everything good in life. I read a newspaper article about a young couple with two small children. You know the story. Hot-dog gumbo for dinner. Of course, neither of them is working. Theyre on welfare and food stamps but they still somehow have enough money for cable and long distance. They tell the reporter they need them"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"Sherrie Chin-Watt. Chinese American, born in San Francisco. Berkeley B.A. Did her law degree at Boalt. Law Review. Her parents run a small wig shop. Nothing special. Shes around your age, Harry, thirty-three or thirty-four. Was married last year to your garden-variety investment banker, corporate finance. Her first marriage, his second. He works too much, sixty, sixty-five hours a week. Headed for the grave. Again nothing special, no real angle there for us. They own a co-op on Central Park West and a bungalow out in East Hampton. No children as yet. She suffers from endometriosis. Whered you get that? I asked. Im friendly with a prominent gynecologist. Coincidence. Jesus. She had a successful laser surgery last year, though shes not pregnant yet. They sleep in separate rooms because he snores. Other items. They went to Morocco for their honeymoon. They usually eat out, though not together. She lettered in volleyball in high school. Solid setter. She still calls home twice a week. What else? Before signing on with Kwang last year, she was an attorney for the ACLU office in"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I dont have any deep problems with her. I know this must sound spiteful. She has her shortcomings, certainly, but I wont go into them because once you start ticking things off they just keep going until they take on a life of their own, which neither truth nor good intention can withstand. What will I say? Lelia is mostly wonderful. And lovely. She has a prominent nose that seems just right and slightly off kilter at the same time. Her eyes are wide-set. She doesnt much fuss with her hair. When you hand her a football she instantly spins it to the laces and says, Go out. Each morning she rises at 6:30 and stretches in her underwear and makes a good pot of coffee. She always scalds the milk. I go in the kitchen and believe I will never see a more perfect set of hip bones. Or uglier feet. I know how her voice will sound with the first word of the day, not as low as it should be and as spare and clean as light. That effortless pitch. When she play-acts, horses around, she is silly and awkward, completely unconvincing. She must be the worst actor on earth. And perhaps most I loved this about her, her helpless way, love it still, how she cant hide a single thing, that she looks hurt when she is hurt, seems happy when happy. That I know at every moment the precise place where she stands. What else can move a man like me, who would find nothing as siren or comforting?"
8/4/22,Native Speaker,"I told him how I didnt know the subtle nuances or meanings of Korean names, even though I knew quite a few, that it would have been like naming someone purely by sound. And he wouldnt want an American name, because everybody else had one, because it was all so ordinary, even if convenient. I described him for the doctor, his walking before me in the schoolyard, stamping the blacktop, announcing our presence with his swagger, his shout. He knew karate, kung fu, tae kwon do, jujitsu. He could beat up the big black kids if he wished, the tough Puerto Rican kids, anyone else who called us names or made slanty eyes. The white boys admired him for his athleticism, how far past the fence he could send a kickball. The white girls were especially fond of him. He often kissed them after school, in front of everyone. He knew all about science, about model rocketry, chemistry sets, baseball cards, about American history. He was the lead in the school play. He spoke a singing beautiful English. He made public speeches. My mother and father were so proud of him. He was better than anyone. He was perfect. In my imagination these blinding halos of terror and beauty rung him, or maybe they were the same, as though he were limited somehow by his own unbearable preeminence and in that way given over to a doom in his life. In the daytime I could feel him near me, sense not so much his friendship but his vigilance and guidance, the veil of his cover. But at night, alone in my bed, my stomach would burn, ache anxiously for his well-being. I feared he would perish in some accident wherever he was (when he didnt need to be with me), that he was going to die tragically, drown in a lake or slip and fall off a cliff; it wouldnt be his fault, it wouldnt be anyones, just that it would happen without warning or reason. And soon Id find myself knotted into a hard coil in the bed, the points of my knees jabbing back the stabs of worry in my stomach and chest, and I wondered if in the morning after I left the house for the long walk to school he would be there for me, at my flank again, that comely wall of him, talking his trash and his resplendence, talking me up, too, talking my story.

7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"strange layout of the monument. The fact is that, ordinarily, a Greek temple was built in accordance with a stereotyped schema: a vestibule (pronaos), then a central hall containing the cult statue (naos), and, finally, a back room (opisthodomos), for the use of the temple staff"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"It is probably totally pointless to regard Pericles as the leader of a political party—as if any such structures existed in Athens—or to interpret the building site on the Acropolis as the fruit of Keynesian policies avant la lettre, with Pericles assuming the mantle of Roosevelt"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Meanwhile, the author of the Constitution of the Athenians—whether Aristotle himself or a member of his school—unequivocally criticizes the introduction of the misthos and accuses Pericles of having sought by this means to corrupt the masses.

7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Alcibiades] once wished to see Pericles and went to his house.

7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"All the same, the fact remains that, in the imaginary representations of the Athenians and of their allies, this building remained closely associated with the onward march of the empire, for was it not used to shelter the leagues treasury, which was transferred to Athens in 454 B.C., at the latest?"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Athena visited the stratēgos outside any ritual framework, short-circuiting the traditional mediations and leaving the dreamer and the goddess face to face. The anecdote thus places Pericles in a privileged position vis-à-vis the goddess, as a mediator and quasi-diviner between the goddess and the wounded man"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,It is surely not merely by chance that the four columns that supported the roofing of this room were in the Ionic style. Incorporating this Ionic style at the very heart of a Doric edifice was a way for the Athenians to give material expression to their domination over a league made up chiefly of Ionian cities
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Phēmē thus acted upon the very heart of reality, as a great subterranean power, an essential part of what is held to be true.63 It oriented the actions of the Athenian leaders, who were often enough obliged to dance to the tune of slander, in order to save their very lives: rumor, the eternal accuser (katēgoron athanaton)"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Perhaps nothing makes more clear the reality of democracy in Athens, of the control of policy by the ekklesia, than this incident: the ekklesia rejects the advice of its most powerful statesman and most persuasive orator, but the latter remains in office, subordinate to the peoples will, till the people choose to get rid of him"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"To invoke its prestige was to risk being reproached not only for impiety at a religious level but also for tyrannical aspirations at a political level. Within a democratic context, a prestigious birth was certainly a doubleedged weapon that had to be handled very carefully indeed, humoring the peoples touchiness as much as possible"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"His opponents also blamed him for having sometimes prevented his political rivals from fighting in the best of conditions, even to the point of endangering the whole city. For example, he was said to have forbidden Cimon to take part in the battle of Tanagra, in 457, in order to prevent this troublesome rival from returning to favor"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Pericles was a past master not only of public speaking but also of the art of remaining silent or, to be more precise, of getting his political allies to speak in his place: in order not to saturate the crowds with his own presence, often I he would remain in the background so as to make his own rare public appearances more solemn and striking"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"the census disqualifications that had been established at the beginning of the sixth century were progressively removed, although access to the post of archon continued to be denied to the thetes.

7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Cleon initiated a new mode of communication between the leaders and the dēmos, and it was destined to enjoy a fine future. In the fourth century, the orator Aeschines reminisced about a time in the past when orators spoke in a more measured fashion, with one hand placed beneath a fold in their clothing—the himation—thereby conveying their moderation and distinction:"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Far from being a temple,43 the Parthenon was a treasury and a monument that glorified imperialism and symbolized the hardening or even petrification of Athenian domination. In this respect, the chronology is significant: the construction of the Parthenon began in 447, one year before the great Euboean revolt, and it was completed in 438, one year after the Samos affair"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"In, at the latest, 454 B.C., at the height of its influence, the federal treasury was transferred to the Acropolis. Now the Athenians could draw on it as they wished, in order to finance the functioning of their democracy. But among their allies, these developments gave rise to discontent that was all the more fervent given that the Persian peril had been dispelled as early as the 460s"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Pericles made use of Menippus for the position of general, humbled the Council of the Areopagus by means of Ephialtes, passed the decree against the Megarians by means of Charinus, and sent Lampon out as founder of Thurii. For, when power seems to be distributed among many, not only does the weight of hatreds and enmities become less troublesome, but there is also greater efficiency in the conduct of affairs"

7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"Once, at a time when he had been abused and insulted all day long by a certain lewd fellow of the baser sort, he endured it all quietly, though it was in the market place, where he had urgent business to transact, and towards evening went away homewards unruffled, the fellow following along and heaping all manner of contumely upon him. When he was about to go indoors, it being now dark, he ordered a servant to take a torch and escort the fellow in safety back to his own home"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"the huge dimensions of the naos contrast strongly with the limited area taken up by the pronaos and the opisthodomos (figure 6). The fact was that the central hall had to be spacious enough to house the immense statue of Athena Parthenos. Then, an extra room, with four columns, was set between the naos and the opisthodomos: a hall that gave its name to the edifice as a whole, the Parthenon, the room for the virgin.42 It was in this space that the city treasures were stored, in particular the treasury of the Delian League"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"The individuals place in society depends largely on the influence of his or her family circle and his or her network of friends. The Greek cities were no exception to that rule: there were no self-made men in Antiquity! In Athens as elsewhere, ones family and friends were indispensable sources of support for anyone desiring a political career. All the same, in a democratic context, what was normally a trump card could turn out to be a handicap. To come from an illustrious family, make a brilliant marriage, and have powerful friends was potentially to be suspected of acting contrary to the interests of the people or even of aspiring to tyranny"
7/25/22,Pericles of Athens,"With very few exceptions, the attitude of the philosophers is negative. Among Socrates disciples, Pericles becomes a subject of reflection both political and philosophical, and soon turns into an anti-model. Antisthenes (445–365), an admirer of Sparta and full of contempt for democracy, criticizes Pericles openly and showers insults upon his companion, Aspasia. As for Plato, he presents the stratēgos as a dangerous demagogue who corrupts the masses and is incapable even of raising his own children in a suitable manner. The Socratics thus used Pericles as a foil, within the framework of critical thinking about democracy and its innately vicious functioning"

7/5/22,Senex &amp; Puer (Uniform Edition of the Writings of James Hillman Book 3),"We have let the basic dualism of the structure force us into taking a stand, the familiar ego stance of a positive or negative position. It is this division itself, and not what we judge to be positive or negative, that puts us into senex consciousness. All such judgments about an archetype are from the ego, who takes from the archetype what it wants for its own self-preservation, rejecting as negative the other side and thereby building up compensatorily yet more negativity. In making this negative judgment it is guided by the senex. Negativity seems necessary to the senex. Why?"

6/26/22,True Meditation: Discover the Freedom of Pure Awareness,"Moving Beyond the Meditator The second aspect of True Meditation is meditative self-inquiry. Meditative self-inquiry is the practice of introducing a question—a spiritual question of power and significance—into the meditative state of mind. We are not just asking any old question; we are asking questions of real worth, questions that have the power to penetrate through layers of conditioning to reach our essential nature. The most powerful question we can ask is simply"
6/26/22,True Meditation: Discover the Freedom of Pure Awareness,"Happiness is an altered state of consciousness. Sadness is an altered state of consciousness. Depression is an altered state of consciousness. Then, of course, there are all the mystical states of consciousness: merging with the cosmos is an altered state of consciousness; feeling your consciousness expand is an altered state of consciousness. There are many varieties of altered states of consciousness. Most people think enlightenment is some altered state of consciousness. This is a profound misunderstanding. Enlightenment is the natural state of consciousness, the innocent state of consciousness, that state which is uncontaminated by the movement of thought, uncontaminated by control or manipulation of mind"
6/26/22,True Meditation: Discover the Freedom of Pure Awareness,"When most people sit down to meditate the first thing they think is, Okay, how do I control my mind? Thats what I am calling manipulation. Manipulation is a strong word, but I am using it to get your attention, to call attention to the fact that when we sit down to meditate and ask ourselves, Okay, how am I going to control my mind? How am I going to come to peace? How am I going to come to stillness?, what the mind is actually doing is asking, How do I control myself so that I feel better? And you can learn to control your mind and quiet your mind and your body by applying a controlling technique. For a while it might feel good. But when we control our minds in order to obtain a certain state of peace or tranquility, its very much like getting someone to be quiet by taping their mouth shut. Youve succeeded in getting that person to be quiet, but youve done it through a very manipulative technique. What good will come of getting that person to be quiet by taping their mouth shut? As soon as you take the tape off they are going to have a few things to say, arent they? Theyre going to have an awful lot to say!"

6/7/22,Dopamine Nation: Finding Balance in the Age of Indulgence,"Lessons of the Balance The relentless pursuit of pleasure (and avoidance of pain) leads to pain. Recovery begins with abstinence. Abstinence resets the brains reward pathway and with it our capacity to take joy in simpler pleasures. Self-binding creates literal and metacognitive space between desire and consumption, a modern necessity in our dopamine-overloaded world. Medications can restore homeostasis, but consider what we lose by medicating away our pain. Pressing on the pain side resets our balance to the side of pleasure. Beware of getting addicted to pain. Radical honesty promotes awareness, enhances intimacy, and fosters a plenty mindset. Prosocial shame affirms that we belong to the human tribe. Instead of running away from the world, we can find escape by immersing ourselves in it"

4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,Our being is not to be enriched merely by activity or experience as such. Everything depends on the quality of our acts and our experiences

4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"The reason why men are so anxious to see themselves, instead of being content to be themselves, is that they do not really believe in their own existence"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,The deep secrecy of my own being is often hidden from me by my own estimate of what I am. My idea of what I am is falsified by my admiration for what I do
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"It is supreme humility to see that ordinary life, embraced with perfect faith, can be more saintly and more supernatural than a spectacular ascetical career"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"We never discover what it is like to make a success of our own work, because we do not want to undertake any work that is merely proportionate to our powers"

4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"At the same time pure love is prudent. It is enlightened with a clear-sighted discretion. Trained in freedom, it knows how to avoid the selfishness that frustrates its action"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,The first step to unselfish love is the recognition that our love may be deluded. We must first of all purify our love by renouncing the pleasure of loving as an end in itself
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"No: the fulfillment of every individual vocation demands not only the renouncement of what is evil in itself, but also of all the precise goods that are not willed for us by God"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,Who is willing to be satisfied with a job that expresses all his limitations? He will accept such work only as a means of livelihood while he waits to discover his true vocation
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,The value of our activity depends almost entirely on the humility to accept ourselves as we are. The reason why we do things so badly is that we are not content to do what we can
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"But, above all, we must learn our own weakness in order to awaken to a new order of action and of being—and experience God Himself accomplishing in us the things we find impossible"

4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"Some people find, in the end, that they have made many wrong guesses and that their paradoxical vocation is to go through life guessing wrong. It takes them a long time to find out that they are happier that way"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,It is useless to try to make peace with ourselves by being pleased with everything we have done. In order to settle down in the quiet of our own being we must learn to be detached from the results of our own activity
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"St. Paul teaches (II Thessalonians 3) that Christian humility and asceticism should normally help us to lead quite ordinary lives, peacefully earning our bread and working from day to day in a world that will pass away"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"We do not live merely in order to do something—no matter what. Activity is just one of the normal expressions of life, and the life it expresses is all the more perfect when it sustains itself with an ordered economy of action"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"Love is perfect in proportion to its freedom. It is free in proportion to its purity. We act most freely when we act purely in response to the love of God. But the purest love of God is not servile, not blind, not limited by fear"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"I can see my eyes in a mirror. My soul can also reflect itself in the mirror of its own activity. But what is seen in the mirror is only the reflection of who I am, not my true being. The mirror of words and actions only partly manifests my being"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"It is, therefore, a very great thing to be little, which is to say: to be ourselves. And when we are truly ourselves we lose most of the futile self-consciousness that keeps us constantly comparing ourselves with others in order to see how big we are"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"Solitude, humility, self-denial, action and contemplation, the sacraments, the monastic life the family and of these make sense except in relation to the central reality which is Gods love living and acting in those whom He has incorporated in His Christ"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"By salvation I mean first of all the full discovery of who he himself really is. Then I mean something of the fulfillment of his own God-given powers, in the love of others and of God. I mean also the discovery that he cannot find himself in himself alone"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"brother. This division cannot be healed by a love that places itself only on one side of the rift. Love must reach over to both sides and draw them together. We cannot love ourselves unless we love others, and we cannot love others unless we love ourselves"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"We cannot master everything, taste everything, understand everything, drain every experience to its last dregs. But if we have the courage to let almost everything else go, we will probably be able to retain the one thing necessary for us—whatever it may be"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"The relative perfection which we must attain to in this life if we are to live as sons of God is not the twenty-four-hour-a-day production of perfect acts of virtue, but a life from which practically all the obstacles to Gods love have been removed or overcome"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"The saint, therefore, is sanctified not only by fasting when he should fast but also by eating when he should eat. He is not only sanctified by his prayers in the darkness of the night, but by the sleep that he takes in obedience to God, Who made us what we are"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,Gratitude and confidence and freedom from ourselves: these are signs that we have found our vocation and are living up to it even though everything else may seem to have gone wrong. They give us peace in any suffering. They teach us to laugh at despair. And we may have to
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"One of the chief obstacles to this perfection of selfless charity is the selfish anxiety to get the most out of everything, to be a brilliant success in our own eyes and in the eyes of other men. We can only get rid of this anxiety by being content to miss something in almost everything we do"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"But the purity of our conscience has a natural proportion with the depth of our being and the quality of our acts: and when our activity is habitually disordered, our malformed conscience can think of nothing better to tell us than to multiply the quantity of our acts, without perfecting their quality"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"The freedom that is exercised in the choice of priestly vocations is a mystery hidden in God, a mystery that reaches out of the obscurity of Gods Providence to select, sometimes, unlikely men to be other Christs and sometimes to reject those who are, in the eyes of men, best fitted for such a vocation"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"If we really know ourselves we quietly take our proper place in the order designed by God. And so supernatural humility adds much to our human dignity by integrating us in the society of other men and placing us in our right relation to them and to God. Pride makes us artificial, and humility makes us real"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"The only effective answer to the problem of salvation must therefore reach out to embrace both extremes of a contradiction at the same time. Hence that answer must be supernatural. That is why all the answers that are not supernatural are imperfect: for they only embrace one of the contradictory terms, and they can always be denied by the other"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"In order to find God in ourselves, we must stop looking at ourselves, stop checking and verifying ourselves in the mirror of our own futility, and be content to be in Him and to do whatever He wills, according to our limitations, judging our acts not in the light of our own illusions, but in the light of His reality which is all around us in the things and people we live with"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"Music is pleasing not only because of the sound but because of the silence that is in it: without the alternation of sound and silence there would be no rhythm. If we strive to be happy by filling all the silences of life with sound, productive by turning all lifes leisure into work, and real by turning all our being into doing, we will only succeed in producing a hell on earth"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"We do not exist for ourselves alone, and it is only when we are fully convinced of this fact that we begin to love ourselves properly and thus also love others. What do I mean by loving ourselves properly? I mean, first of all, desiring to live, accepting life as a very great gift and a great good, not because of what it gives us, but because of what it enables us to give to others"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"2. Do not stress too much the fact that love seeks to penetrate the intimate secrets of the beloved. Those who are too fond of this idea fall short of true love, because they violate the solitude of those they love, instead of respecting it. True love penetrates the secrets and the solitude of the beloved by allowing him to keep his secrets to himself and to remain in his own solitude"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"The man who completely trusts his own estimate of himself is doomed to sterility. All he asks of any act he performs is that it be his act. If it is performed by him, it must be good. All words spoken by him must be infallible. The car he has just bought is the best for its price, for no other reason than that he is the one who has bought it. He seeks no other fruit than this, and therefore he generally gets no other"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"They must struggle to escape their true being, and verify a false existence by constantly viewing what they themselves do. They have to keep looking in the mirror for reassurance. What do they expect to see? Not themselves! They are hoping for some sign that they have become the god they hope to become by means of their own frantic activity—invulnerable, all powerful, infinitely wise, unbearably beautiful, unable to die!"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"We must be content to live without watching ourselves live, to work without expecting an immediate reward, to love without an instantaneous satisfaction, and to exist without any special recognition. It is only when we are detached from ourselves that we can be at peace with ourselves. We cannot find happiness in our work if we are always extending ourselves beyond ourselves and beyond the sphere of our work in order to find ourselves greater than we are"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"All these three answers are insufficient. The third says we must love only ourselves. The second says we must love only another. The first says that in loving another we simply seek the most effective way to love ourselves. The true answer, which is supernatural, tells us that we must love ourselves in order to be able to love others, that we must find ourselves by giving ourselves to them. The words of Christ are clear: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"All vocations are intended by God to manifest His love in the world. For each special calling gives a man some particular place in the Mystery of Christ, gives him something to do for the salvation of all mankind. The difference between the various vocations lies in the different ways in which each one enables men to discover Gods love, appreciate it, respond to it, and share it with other men. Each vocation has for its aim the propagation of divine life in the world"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"There is something in the depths of our being that hungers for wholeness and finality. Because we are made for eternal life, we are made for an act that gathers up all the powers and capacities of our being and offers them simultaneously and forever to God. The blind spiritual instinct that tells us obscurely that our own lives have a particular importance and purpose, and which urges us to find out our vocation, seeks in so doing to bring us to a decision that will dedicate our lives irrevocably to their true purpose"
4/11/22,No Man Is an Island,"To love another is to will what is really good for him. Such love must be based on truth. A love that sees no distinction between good and evil, but loves blindly merely for the sake of loving, is hatred, rather than love. To love blindly is to love selfishly, because the goal of such love is not the real advantage of the beloved but only the exercise of love in our own souls. Such love cannot seem to be love unless it pretends to seek the good of the one loved. But since it actually cares nothing for the truth, and never considers that it may go astray, it proves itself to be selfish. It does not seek the true advantage of the beloved or even our own. It is not interested in the truth, but only in itself. It proclaims itself content with an apparent good: which is the exercise of love for its own sake, without any consideration of the good or bad effects of loving"

4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,What is this inner femininity which Parsifal is to stay aloof from? It is all the softness of femininity that is so valuable in an inner sense but that would vitiate him if he mistook it and lived it in an outer sense

4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"Man has only two alternatives for relationship to his inner woman: either he rejects her and she turns against him in the form of bad moods and undermining seductions, or he accepts her and finds within a companion who walks through life with him giving him warmth and strength"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,Creativity in a man is directly linked with his inner feminine capacity for growth and creation. Genius in a man is his interior feminine capacity to give birth; it is his masculinity which gives him capacity for putting that creativity into form and structure in the outer world
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"Until the Parsifal part of a mans nature appears, there is a feminine part of him that has never smiled, that is incapable of happiness, and she bursts into laughter and joy at the sight of Parsifal. If one can awaken the Parsifal in a man, another quality in him immediately becomes happy"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"In 1948 and 1949 he was jubilant at the new dogma of the Catholic church which placed the Virgin Mary with the Trinity, all masculine figures, in Heaven.

4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"The Red Knight is the shadow side of masculinity, the negative, potentially destructive power. To truly become a man the shadow personality must be struggled with, but it cannot be repressed.

4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"Most modern people, asked this question in understandable terms for our time, would reply that I am the center of gravity; I work to improve my life; I am working toward my goals; I am increasing my equity; I am making something of myself—or most common of all—I am searching for happiness, which is to say that I want the Grail to serve me"

A rose from her hand or a glance of approval is sufficient to provide motive and strength for the most heroic of deeds. Though"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,Many legends put our cure in the hands of a fool or someone most unlikely to carry healing power. The myth is telling us that it is the naive part of a man that will heal him and cure his Fisher King wound. It suggests that if a man is to be cured he must find something in himself about the same age and about the same mentality as he was when he was wounded
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"Like Parsifal, he is unprepared for this and does not have the possession to ask the question that would make the experience conscious and stable within him. No youth could be expected to do anything but wander into the castle, be overwhelmed by it, and the next morning find himself back in the same ordinary world—if he has not been unhorsed by the drawbridge"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"A man is not master in his own interior house when he is in a mood. A usurper has taken first place and the mans response will be to fight the usurper. Unfortunately, he often chooses to fight this battle on the wrong level—in other words he will fight with his wife or his environment instead of facing the battle within, which would be the only appropriate action"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"It is extremely reassuring to see that it is often in his blunders that he finds the next stage of his development. If it were not for this benevolent fact all the Parsifals of the world would have fallen off the edge of the flat world and vanished into the oblivion they deserve. Don Quixote, the archfool of all time, makes his sublime journey entirely by way of nonsense"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,In this realm there is no happiness or unhappiness in the usual sense but only that state of being that is correctly called Ecstasy. It is bitter on the tongue to admit that this is the gift of the Hideous Damsel but there is no other carrier of so sublime a gift. Perhaps this was known to the author of the medieval statement that Suffering is the swiftest steed to redemption
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"This is a fine bit of advice for a youth; the masculine equipment he carries with him, largely imitation of the father-teachers around him, will not hold up when he tries to use it by himself. Every youth has to go through the humiliation of finding that his imitation masculinity will not hold up. And more, only the father who gave him his sword can repair the broken instrument"

4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"The number five implies the completion of life and is the root from which we form our word, quintessence, the fifth essence. Five implies completion. The five is everywhere, but elusively, also nowhere. It seems cruel to flash a vision of completion to a sixteen-year-old boy and set him on the road to find embodiment of that quality. But such is the motivation of any true spiritual life"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"An awkward time comes when life is dominated by three; it must be reduced to one or increased to four. Three, or that consciousness represented by three, can not long be endured in its intensity and drivenness. If one finds himself in a paralyzing dilemma, he must make the forward thrust to attain an enlightened place of insight, the fourness, or else reduce his consciousness just to survive"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"How many times have women said to their men: Look at all the good things you have; you have the best job you have ever had in your life. Our income is better than ever. We have two cars. We have two and sometimes three day weekends. Why arent you happy? The Grail is at hand; why arent you happy? The man is too inarticulate to reply, Because I am a Fisher King and am wounded and cannot touch any of this happiness"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"As in the story of the Fisher King coming upon the roasting salmon, a boy in his early adolescence touches something of the Christ nature within himself but touches it too soon. He is unexpectedly wounded by it and drops it immediately as being too hot. But a bit of it gets into his mouth and he can never forget the experience. His first contact with what will be redemption for him later in his life is a wounding"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"But a day comes when their genius is absolutely necessary to make a transition to another stage of life—for themselves or for someone in their environment. Just to know of this validity is a safeguard for such a person. Please be good to your own hermit quality or the born hermit in your circle of friends. If you have a born hermit as a son, dont push him into Red Knight experiences but let him find his own forest way"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,A few minutes into the performance I was so unhappy that I had to leave. It was then that I knew that the pursuit of beauty or happiness was in vain since I could not partake of the beauty even though it was immediately at hand. No worse or frightening pain is possible for us than to realize that our capacity for love or beauty or happiness is limited. No further outward effort is possible if our inward capacity is wounded
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"The legend in the Court is that when the best knight in the world appears, the damsel who has not smiled for six years will burst into laughter. The instant this damsel sees Parsifal, she bursts into laughter and joy. The Court is mightily impressed with this; apparently the best knight in the world has appeared! Here is this naive youth, this boy in a homespun garment, completely untutored, and the maiden is laughing. Extraordinary!"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"Many men find the whole experience of Grail castles so painful, so incomprehensible, that they immediately repress it and say, I dont remember. Like all repressed things in the unconscious, far from having gotten rid of it, we find it is everywhere, behind every tree and around every corner, looking over the shoulder of every person we meet. The hunger for something, the Saturday night restlessness, the tires squealing around the corner are all"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"One has a chance again at the Grail castle in middle age. The Grail is always near one and available at any moment but sixteen and forty-five, times of change, seem to be the two points in a mans life when it is most easily found. That miraculous procession goes on every night of ones life in the Grail castle; but it is only at particular times in his life—and then only when he has prepared for it—that a man has easy access to the splendor of the Grail castle"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"To feel is the sublime art of having a value structure and a sense of meaning—where one belongs, where ones allegiance is, where ones roots are. To mood (we are already in difficulty since there is no adequate term for being caught up in a mood) is to be in the grips of the feminine part of our nature, to be overwhelmed by an irrational element that plays havoc with a mans outer life. The feminine side of a man is to connect him within the depths of his inner being and to make a bridge to his deepest self.2"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"The Fisher King is lying on his litter enduring his suffering while a procession of profound beauty takes place. A fair maiden brings in the lance which pierced the side of Christ at the crucifixion, another maiden brings the paten which held the bread at the Last Supper, another maiden brings the Grail itself which glows with light from its own depth. Each person is given wine from the Grail and realizes their deepest wish even before they voice that wish. Each person, that is, except the wounded Fisher King who may not drink from the Grail"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"A Chinese story has it: a fish heard some men talking on a pier about a miraculous substance called water. The fish was so intrigued that he called his fish friends together and profoundly announced he was going in quest of this wonderful stuff. They gave him a fitting ceremony and sent him on his way. Long after they had given him up as lost on his perilous journey he swam home, old, tired, worn. They hastened to greet him and asked urgently, Did you find it? Did you find it? Yes, replied the old fish, but you would not believe what I found. Whereupon the old fish swam slowly away"
4/5/22,He: Understanding Masculine Psychology,"Dr. Jung knew where to look for the cure of his desperate wound and looked to his inner world. He locked himself in his room and waited on the unconscious. Soon he was down on the floor playing childish games. This led to the recall of his childhood fantasies which soon filled his attention. For months he labored daily in the privacy of his fantasy and in his backyard he built stone villages, towns and forts. He had fantasied all of this as a boy. He trusted his childlike experience and that was the beginning of an outpouring from the collective unconscious from which we have the legacy of Jungian psychology. A great man was humble (earthy) enough to trust his Parsifal for his cure"

2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"the Latin word idem, meaning same and facere, which means to make. So when I identify with something, I make it the same. The same as what? The same as I. I endow it with a sense of self, and so it becomes part of my identity"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"One of the unconscious assumptions is that by identifying with an object through the fiction of ownership, the apparent solidity and permanency of that material object will endow your sense of self with greater solidity and permanency"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"It endows the world and the ego with a heaviness and an absolute importance that makes you take yourself and the world very seriously. The play of form is then misperceived as a struggle for survival, and when that is your perception, it becomes your reality"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Inner purpose concerns Being and is primary. Outer purpose concerns doing and is secondary. While this book speaks mainly of your inner purpose, this chapter and the next will also address the question of how to align outer purpose and inner purpose in your life"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Some of the change may be initiated by themselves, not through an agonizing decision-making process but by a sudden realization or recognition: This is what I have to do. The decision arrives ready-made, so to speak. It comes through awareness, not through thinking"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"The ego identifies with having, but its satisfaction in having is a relatively shallow and short-lived one. Concealed within it remains a deep-seated sense of dissatisfaction, of incompleteness, of not enough. I dont have enough yet, by which the ego really means, I am not enough yet"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"To refrain from identifying with the body doesnt mean that you neglect, despise, or no longer care for it. If it is strong, beautiful, or vigorous, you can enjoy and appreciate those attributes—while they last. You can also improve the bodys condition through right nutrition and exercise"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Seeing the madness of our civilization so clearly, they may feel somewhat alienated from the culture around them. Some feel that they inhabit a no-mans-land between two worlds. They are no longer run by the ego, yet the arising awareness has not yet become fully integrated into their lives"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"When you are invited, go and sit in the lowest place so that when your host comes, he may say to you, friend, move up higher. Then you will be honored in the presence of all who sit at table with you. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"There may also be things in our lives that we value because of their beauty or inherent quality. We need to honor the world of things, not despise it. Each thing has Beingness, is a temporary form that has its origin within the formless one Life, the source of all things, all bodies, all forms"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"How are they reconciled? By realizing that your entire life journey ultimately consists of the step you are taking at this moment. There is always only this one step, and so you give it your fullest attention. This doesnt mean you dont know where you are going; it just means this step is primary, the destination secondary"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"The decision to make the present moment into your friend is the end of the ego. The ego can never be in alignment with the present moment, which is to say, aligned with life, since its very nature compels it to ignore, resist, or devalue the Now. Time is what the ego lives on. The stronger the ego, the more time takes over your life"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Is it wrong then to be proud of ones possessions or to feel resentful toward people who have more than you? Not at all. That sense of pride, of needing to stand out, the apparent enhancement of ones self through more than and diminishment through less than is neither right nor wrong—it is the ego. The ego isnt wrong; its just unconscious"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Jesus goes on to say that if God clothes simple flowers in such beauty, how much more will God clothe you. That is to say, that while nature is a beautiful expression of the evolutionary impulse of the universe, when humans become aligned with the intelligence that underlies it, they will express that same impulse on a higher, more wondrous level"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Whatever you do, you will be doing extraordinarily well, because the doing itself becomes the focal point of your attention. Your doing then becomes a channel through which consciousness enters this world. This means there is quality in what you do, even in the most simple action, like turning the pages in the phone book or walking across the room"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"When faced with a radical crisis, when the old way of being in the world, of interacting with each other and with the realm of nature doesnt work anymore, when survival is threatened by seemingly insurmountable problems, an individual life-form—or a species—will either die or become extinct or rise above the limitations of its condition through an evolutionary leap"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"The initiation of the awakening process is an act of grace. You cannot make it happen nor can you prepare yourself for it or accumulate credits toward it. There isnt a tidy sequence of logical steps that leads toward it, although the mind would love that. You dont have to become worthy first. It may come to the sinner before it comes to the saint, but not necessarily"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"The illusion that you are separate from the power that runs the universe returns. You feel yourself to be alone again, struggling against something or trying to achieve this or that. But why did anxiety, stress, or negativity arise? Because you turned away from the present moment. And why did you do that? You thought something else was more important. You forgot your main purpose"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"You need to be alert and honest to find out, for example, whether your sense of self-worth is bound up with things you possess. Do certain things induce a subtle feeling of importance or superiority? Does the lack of them make you feel inferior to others who have more than you? Do you casually mention things you own or show them off to increase your sense of worth in someone elses eyes and through them in your own?"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"What is lost on the level of form is gained on the level of essence. In the traditional figure of the blind seer or the wounded healer of ancient cultures and legend, some great loss or disability on the level of form has become an opening into spirit. When you have had a direct experience of the unstable nature of all forms, you will likely never overvalue form again and thus lose yourself by blindly pursuing it or attaching yourself to it"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"For many people, particularly in the West, death is no more than an abstract concept, and so they have no idea what happens to the human form when it approaches dissolution. Most decrepit and old people are shut away in nursing homes. Dead bodies, which in some older cultures are on open display for all to see, are hidden away. Try to see a dead body, and you will find that it is virtually illegal, except if the deceased is a close family member"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Whatever you think people are withholding from you—praise, appreciation, assistance, loving care, and so on—give it to them. You dont have it? Just act as if you had it, and it will come. Then, soon after you start giving, you will start receiving. You cannot receive what you dont give. Outflow determines inflow. Whatever you think the world is withholding from you, you already have, but unless you allow it to flow out, you wont even know that you have it"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"The modalities of awakened doing are acceptance, enjoyment, and enthusiasm. Each one represents a certain vibrational frequency of consciousness. You need to be vigilant to make sure that one of them operates whenever you are engaged in doing anything at all—from the most simple task to the most complex. If you are not in the state of either acceptance, enjoyment, or enthusiasm, look closely and you will find that you are creating suffering for yourself and others"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"The separation of thinking and awareness, which lies at the core of your primary purpose, happens through the negation of time. We are not speaking here, of course, of the use of time for practical purposes, such as making an appointment or planning a trip. We are not speaking of clock time, but of psychological time, which is the minds deep-seated habit of seeking the fullness of life in the future where it cannot be found and ignoring the only point of access to it: the present moment"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Would living like this not stop me from looking to achieve something great? My fear is that I will remain stuck with doing little things for the rest of my life, things that are of no consequence. Im afraid of never rising above mediocrity, never daring to achieve anything great, not fulfilling my potential. The great arises out of small things that are honored and cared for. Everybodys life really consists of small things. Greatness is a mental abstraction and a favorite fantasy of the ego"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Such events represent the beginning of the return movement toward the dissolution of form. In most ancient cultures, there must have been an intuitive understanding of this process, which is why old people were respected and revered. They were the repositories of wisdom and provided the dimension of depth without which no civilization can survive for long. In our civilization, which is totally identified with the outer and ignorant of the inner dimension of spirit, the word old has mainly negative connotations"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"You cannot make the egoless state into a future goal and then work toward it. All you get is more dissatisfaction, more inner conflict, because it will always seem that you have not arrived yet, have not attained that state yet. When freedom from ego is your goal for the future, you give yourself more time, and more time means more ego. Look carefully to find out if your spiritual search is a disguised form of ego. Even trying to get rid of your self can be a disguised search for more if the getting rid of your self is made into a future goal"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Lets say that you are a businessperson and after two years of intense stress and strain you finally manage to come out with a product or service that sells well and makes money. Success? In conventional terms, yes. In reality, you spent two years polluting your body as well as the earth with negative energy, made yourself and those around you miserable, and affected many others you never even met. The unconscious assumption behind all such action is that success is a future event, and that the end justifies the means. But the end and the means are one"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Most of their attention is absorbed by thinking, and so they dont really see you, and they are not really listening to you. They are not present in any situation, their attention being either in the past or future which, of course, exist only in the mind as thought forms. Or they relate to you through some kind of role they play and so are not themselves. Most people are alienated from who they are, and some are alienated to such a degree that the way they behave and interact is recognized as phony by almost everyone, except those who are equally phony, equally alienated from who they are"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"Trying to become a good or better human being sounds like a commendable and high-minded thing to do, yet it is an endeavor you cannot ultimately succeed in unless there is a shift in consciousness. This is because it is still part of the same dysfunction, a more subtle and rarified form of self-enhancement, of desire for more and a strengthening of ones conceptual identity, ones self-image. You do not become good by trying to be good, but by finding the goodness that is already within you, and allowing that goodness to emerge. But it can only emerge if something fundamental changes in your state of consciousness"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"How do you let go of attachment to things? Dont even try. Its impossible. Attachment to things drops away by itself when you no longer seek to find yourself in them. In the meantime, just be aware of your attachment to things. Sometimes you may not know that you are attached to something, which is to say, identified, until you lose it or there is the threat of loss. If you then become upset, anxious, and so on, it means you are attached. If you are aware that you are identified with a thing, the identification is no longer total. I am the awareness that is aware that there is attachment. Thats the beginning of the transformation of consciousness"
2/21/22,A New Earth: Awakening to Your Life&#39;s Purpose,"You can just as easily identify with a problematic body and make the bodys imperfection, illness, or disability into your identity. You may then think and speak of yourself as a sufferer of this or that chronic illness or disability. You receive a great deal of attention from doctors and others who constantly confirm to you your conceptual identity as a sufferer or a patient. You then unconsciously cling to the illness because it has become the most important part of who you perceive yourself to be. It has become another thought form with which the ego can identify. Once the ego has found an identity, it does not want to let go. Amazingly but not infrequently, the ego in search of a stronger identity can and does create illnesses in order to strengthen itself through them"

Because of its undifferentiated nature, it is hard to find a name that precisely describes this emotion.

It has led me to lie and to cheat and to pretend—first to myself and then to everyone close to me. It has left me feeling ashamed and isolated. It promised joy and delivered bitterness. Such has been its real value to me; such has been the effect of my allowing some disordered brain circuits to run my life. The real value of my addictive compulsion has been that it has caused me to betray my true values and disregard my true goals

6/24/21,Gods in Everyman: Archetypes That Shape Men&#39;s Lives,"In his music, Apollo was again associated with clarity and purity. In contrast to Dionysian music, which expresses chaos, ecstasy, turbulence, emotional conflicts, and passion, Apollonian music values that clear note, the purity of music that is like higher mathematics, which brings harmony through time and measure and lifts the spirit.

Despite your achievements, you may spend a lot of time thinking about how youve failed at some task or messed up a conversation you had, or even worrying about things you havent done yet. Ironically, this rumination only acts to fuel the stress you feel in doing things and being around people. Rather than self-correct, youre more likely to self-criticize"

When the desire is very great, one is more likely to attain this experience. Then pray: ask and you will receive. The third method that I suggest for encountering God in Christ is repentance. This is the method that Jesus was always preaching"

What were all these people up to? Did they not know that all these things were not literally taking place? Of course they knew! But they understood truth!

In other words, it is the love of comfort and bodily well-being. People will never conquer Mount Everest if they are victims of this love. Sensual love is pampering the senses, a love of satisfying interior and exterior senses. It is pretty similar to carnal love—a flight not only from physical pain, but also from loneliness or emptiness. Finally, worldly love means loving pomp, show, honor, and approval, and avoiding all humiliations"
5/15/21,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,"In time of desolation, Ignatius advises, we should never make any change, but remain firm and constant in the resolution and decision which guided us the day before the desolation, or in the decision to which we adhered in the preceding consolation. For just as in consolation the good spirit guides and counsels us, so in desolation the evil spirit guides and counsels. Following his counsels we can never find the way to a right decision (no. 318). The key idea in this fifth rule is Never change in time of desolation. That is a simple enough rule"
5/15/21,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,"Do not defend; attack! When we are tempted to pray less, we should pray a little more. When we are tempted to eat more, eat a little less. Do not just defend yourself against the enemy. This advice has its value if applied with a certain amount of common sense. If we are tempted after Mass to leave after five minutes, while we had originally planned to stay for ten, we should stay for twelve minutes. What is the advantage of this? It is psychological: We know now that in the future it is useless to be tempted, because we gave ourselves more time"
5/15/21,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,"In order to love others we have to love ourselves. Yet in order to be able to love ourselves, we have to be loved by at least one person. Now, a very few lucky people get this from God. For some peoples psychological well-being this might not be needed. However, if ones spiritual sense is deep and he or she has gone deeper into life, then it is vital. Without it, sooner or later we start to gripe and believe that life is meaningless. It is then that we sense that this emptiness is itself full; that darkness is light. Having this acceptance from God, a person might still be psychologically a neurotic; sometimes, however, this realization overflows into the emotional, and then it is beautiful"
5/15/21,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,"(1) The good spirit does this: first, confusion and humility. Lord I am not worthy. It is thus that all great works begin (for instance, with Moses, Isaiah, Our Lady, Peter, all of them). They are suddenly confronted with the divine and their first response is one of unworthiness: Will I really measure up? I am so inadequate. God consoles them with his power and grace. (2) The next step is the surrender of the heart that is completely disinterested. (3) The third step is charity. One gets to work with great devotedness. (4) And finally: peace in action. To summarize, we start with humility and confusion, we move to surrender of oneself, then on to great devotedness and charity, and then comes peace in action"
5/15/21,Seek God Everywhere: Reflections on the Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius,"Most of the people coming for a retreat have a deep sense of worthlessness; that is, they are full of not-okay feelings. Therefore I stress much more the aspect of how God loves us, as well as the aspect of our sinfulness. And as soon as the retreatants sense Gods love, they want to change. What they need most is the realization of Gods love. Most people come to us wounded today. It is not the sense of sin that they are lacking; it is the sense of lovableness. We have to communicate to people their goodness. A religious sister, for instance, might theoretically see that this is the root of her problem: She cannot praise anyone because she allows no one to praise her; she cannot love because she does not allow anyone to love her; she is giving nothing because she is not receiving anything; and she cannot see others as okay, because she will not see herself as okay. The first thing she must do is see her lovableness"

2/16/21,Less is Enough: On Architecture and Asceticism,"Like performing arts such as acting and dance, monasticism is an art that does not leave behind a product but coincides with the performance itself.

2/16/21,Less is Enough: On Architecture and Asceticism,"As with Pawsons boutique-religious minimalism, and Zumthors aloofness, commercialism is here wrapped with an aura of restraint. This aura, this ideological need to balance market-saturation with pseudo-religious needs, is precisely the tendency that Benjamin saw as arising from the poverty of experience caused by the wealth of information and communication"
2/16/21,Less is Enough: On Architecture and Asceticism,"And yet the difference between the ascetic practices enacted by the monastery and the disciplinary power of these other institutions is as subtle as it is decisive.

2/16/21,Less is Enough: On Architecture and Asceticism,"As we have seen, the perversion of asceticism is not simply its translation as austerity but also its branding as image, which in times of austerity has become not only fashionable but also ideological. And yet it is precisely because economic austerity is a subjective economy, aiming to manipulate the subjects moral and ethical sphere, that asceticism offers also the possibility to emancipate subjectivity from such manipulation"
2/16/21,Less is Enough: On Architecture and Asceticism,"This conversion of asceticism into the potential for development is a betrayal of its core principles. As we have seen, asceticism was conceived to allow autonomy from systems of power. It offers the possibility of designing a form of life that challenges established modes of governance. In capitalism, however, asceticism is appropriated as a moral imperative directing the subject to work harder, produce, accumulate and finally consume more"
2/16/21,Less is Enough: On Architecture and Asceticism,"For Benjamin, poverty of experience does not imply personal poverty, or even abstinence from the abundance of things and ideas that a capitalistic society produces. On the contrary, poverty of experience is precisely the effect of this abundance. Inundated by all sorts of information, stories and beliefs – the oppressive wealth of ideas that has been spread among people, or rather has swamped them entirely, as Benjamin put it – we can no longer trust the depth and richness of human experience"
2/16/21,Less is Enough: On Architecture and Asceticism,"For these subjects Serlio proposes a minimum dwelling unit which clearly reflects the ascetic character of the inhabitant. But here asceticism is not the inhabitants choice. Serlios little house is not for the hermit, or for those who have consciously chosen to reject private property. The poverty embodied by Serlios minimal house is a productive poverty because it makes living conditions for the poor a little more bearable, so enabling them to reproduce their labour and to become productive subjects, workers"
2/16/21,Less is Enough: On Architecture and Asceticism,"For many Christians, the institutionalisation of the Church put it on a path of fatal compromise and decline. Rejecting the new position of ecclesiastical power, the early monks not only chose a life of ascetic solitude (in fact the word monk comes from the Greek monos, alone), they also decided to live outside the law and the rights that defined social life. Monastic life began in the deserts of Syria and Egypt, places that gave the early hermits a cultural tabula rasa where they could start again from scratch"
2/16/21,Less is Enough: On Architecture and Asceticism,"And yet these creative workers have difficulty admitting this reality, and because the field is so competitive, it seems almost impossible for them to organise themselves within something like a union or a social organisation that would protect them from exploitation. Ironically, many of these people already live an ascetic life, but unwillingly, without being capable of giving this life a more autonomous structure, a structure that would enable them, like the early monks, to live according to their own idiorrhythmy, rather than the frantic schedules of post-fordist modes of"

1/22/21,Colonialism/Postcolonialism (The New Critical Idiom),"The process of forming a community in the new land necessarily meant un-forming or re-forming the communities that existed there already, and involved a wide range of practices including trade, settlement, plunder, negotiation, warfare, genocide, and enslavement"
1/22/21,Colonialism/Postcolonialism (The New Critical Idiom),"The point is that violence was readily resorted to wherever necessary, and the enormous differences of strategy in different places indicate the flexibility of colonial ideologies and practices, rather than the absence of the desire for conquest in some colonial ventures"
1/22/21,Colonialism/Postcolonialism (The New Critical Idiom),"One useful way of distinguishing between imperialism and colonialism might be to separate them not in temporal but in spatial terms and to think of imperialism or neo-imperialism as the phenomenon that originates in the metropolis, the process which leads to domination and control"
1/22/21,Colonialism/Postcolonialism (The New Critical Idiom),"Millions of Indians never saw an English person throughout the term of the Raj, although that did not mean their lives had not been woven into the fabric of empire.

1/21/21,Language and Mind,"If we consider the current status of structural linguistic methodology, stimulus-response psycholinguistics (whether or not extended to mediation theory), or probabilistic or automata-theoretic models for language use, we find that in each case a parallel development has taken place: a careful analysis has shown that insofar as the system of concepts and principles that was advanced can be made precise, it can be demonstrated to be inadequate in a fundamental way"

1/11/21,Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration,"It is a descent into the perils besetting mankind, for there is no other way to lift up fallen humanity. Jesus has to enter into the drama of human existence, for that belongs to the core of his mission; he has to penetrate it completely, down to its uttermost depths, in order to find the lost sheep, to bear it on his shoulders, and to bring it home"
1/11/21,Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration,"God is the issue: Is he real, reality itself, or isnt he? Is he good, or do we have to invent the good ourselves? The God question is the fundamental question, and it sets us down right at the crossroads of human existence. What must the Savior of the world do or not do? That is the question the temptations of Jesus are about. The three temptations are identical in Matthew and Luke, but the sequence is different"
1/11/21,Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration,"Moral posturing is part and parcel of temptation. It does not invite us directly to do evil—no, that would be far too blatant. It pretends to show us a better way, where we finally abandon our illusions and throw ourselves into the work of actually making the world a better place. It claims, moreover, to speak for true realism: Whats real is what is right there in front of us—power and bread. By comparison, the things of God fade into unreality, into a secondary world that no one really needs"
1/11/21,Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration,"The actual ritual of Baptism symbolizes this. On one hand, immersion into the waters is a symbol of death, which recalls the death symbolism of the annihilating, destructive power of the ocean flood. The ancient mind perceived the ocean as a permanent threat to the cosmos, to the earth; it was the primeval flood that might submerge all life. The river (Jordan) could also assume this symbolic value for those who were immersed in it. But the flowing waters of the river are above all a symbol of life"
1/11/21,Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration,"At the heart of all temptations, as we see here, is the act of pushing God aside because we perceive him as secondary, if not actually superfluous and annoying, in comparison with all the apparently far more urgent matters that fill our lives. Constructing a world by our own lights, without reference to God, building on our own foundation; refusing to acknowledge the reality of anything beyond the political and material, while setting God aside as an illusion—that is the temptation that threatens us in many varied forms"

10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"However, they begin to relate to people in their imaginations as if others were aesthetic objects, to be contemplated like works of art rather than as persons in their own right"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Their creativity is paradoxical, because Fours are able to express the personal universally, in something that has resonance and meaning beyond what they intend when they create"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Fours are told who they are not by their parents, but by what they discover in their creativity, and in the richness of the lives they live from day to day, from moment to moment"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Thus, adults who are functioning in the lower end of the Levels of Development can be seen as individuals who as children were forced to develop more elaborate systems of defense"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Unfortunately, the great part of their relationships takes place almost solely in their imaginations, without others ever being aware of their attention or the degree of their ardor"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"But as they become more self-conscious, Fours become increasingly drawn into unresolved, contradictory, and irrational feelings which they want to sort out before they dare express them"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Secondary Fears. This indicates a new fear which has arisen in response to the self-image terms at Level 2. The Secondary Fear is more immediately felt, and sometimes obscures the Basic Fear"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"The person has begun shifting his sense of self from personality to essence, and may have also begun incorporating many of the healthy qualities from the type in the Direction of Integration"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"If they are professional artists, they must have discovered which medium is best suited for their talents; they also must have learned their craft so that they can express themselves adequately"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,They control access to themselves because they fear that other people will shame them or point out all of the ways that they are not like the image of themselves they are forming in their imaginations
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"In the artist of all kinds I think one can detect an inherent dilemma, which belongs to the co-existence of two trends, the urgent need to communicate and the still more urgent need not to be found. . . "
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"By using their imaginations, average Fours heighten the emotional impact of relationships, making them into something extremely exciting, while sparing themselves the problems of self-exposure and rejection"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"It also means allowing ones self to let go of the behaviors, attitudes, and desires that one may be clinging to, by recognizing that there are more effective means to realize what one really wants—the Basic Desire"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Fours at One acknowledge that there are values to which it is necessary to submit. They willingly become self-disciplined, working consistently toward actualizing their potentials so they can contribute to the world"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"This is because there are two ways of acting on the Basic Desire, one leading to freedom and the true self of Essence at Level 1, the other leading into the world of the ego at Level 2. We will explore the latter first"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Average Fours still want to be creative, but their creativity becomes somewhat self-conscious and therefore less universal. We can see that healthy Fours are artistic whereas average Fours think of themselves as artistic"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"from the turbulence of their emotions, but that they have found a way to ride that current to some further destination. Healthy Fours have learned to sustain their identities without exclusive reference to their feelings"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Looking at the structure as a whole, we can see that it is fear, again and again, that drives us deeper and deeper into restrictive, painful ego states, and farther and farther from a direct experience of our true nature"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Integrating Fours are able to contemplate their creation, whether it is a work of art, an act of kindness, or a successful relationship, not only learning who they are, but giving themselves reasons for genuine self-esteem"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"They come to disdain many of their real qualities, which they see as barriers to becoming the self of the imagination. Angry with themselves for being defective, Fours inhibit and punish themselves in the many ways which we will see"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"While healthy Fours are stimulating company because they are attentive to others and are curious about the world, average Fours are uninterested in anything that does not immediately impact on their feelings and their quest for identity"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Their creative ideas may also be somewhat unusual, emphasizing the mysterious, even the surreal. They are very attracted to the exotic and the symbolic and tend to be more unusual in their personal presentation—bohemian or, at least, casual"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"By confronting and surmounting the Basic Fear (which arose in early childhood in the process of ego development), the person becomes liberated and moves into a state of ego transcendence where he or she begins to actualize the essential self"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"But if you contemplate the Basic Fear of your own type, you will begin to see its effect in your life. You can also see these Basic Fears as variations of a more central and pervasive fear found in all of the types—the fear of nonbeing, of not existing"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,This would not be as much of a problem for Fours if not for the fact that most of their moods are unpleasant. They dwell on their own shortcomings or simmer with resentment at the slights to their self-image from the crude and insensitive people in their lives
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Healthy, gifted individuals of this subtype are probably the most profoundly creative of all the types because they combine intuition with insight, emotional sensitivity with intellectual comprehension, frequently with stunningly original, even prophetic, results"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"In the example of type Two, this would mean that Twos would need to confront their fear of being unwanted and unworthy of being loved, but also the self-image described under Self-Actualization—that they are not allowed to take care of themselves and their own needs"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"It then follows that the way to lighten the burden of ones more painful, defended states is to follow the spiral up against the arrows. This means allowing ones self to experience the fear at the Level in which one finds ones self, and all the subsequent fears above it"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"The problem with average Fours, however, is that they try to understand themselves by introspecting on their feelings. As they move inward in a search for self, they become so acutely self-conscious that their subjective emotional states become the dominant reality for them"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"However, if they are to continue eliciting the attention of a rescuer, average Fours must also continue to have problems and not allow themselves to become too functional. Although they typically see themselves as loners, they actually require high maintenance from other people"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"However, once a type has identified itself with a certain self-image, another fear must arise, because in truth, the qualities that the person has used to define himself do not represent the entire person. Thus the qualities that contradict the self-image must be defended against"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Note that at Level 3, and in all subsequent Levels, the A-terms represent attitudes or internal states of consciousness which are generally invisible to other people. The B-terms represent behaviors, actions, or styles of self-expression which generally are visible to other people"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"As soon as Fours devote themselves to a search for self by withdrawing from life, they are going in the wrong direction. No matter how necessary this search may seem to them, they must become convinced that the direct search for self is a temptation which eventually leads to despair"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Nevertheless, since revealing their feelings remains essential to their emotional health, any artistic activity average Fours engage in is especially valued because art and beauty become a substitute for themselves, a means of expressing the self through a kind of proxy to the world"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Fours began to inventory all of the ways in which they were unlike the people around them. Eventually, this sense of difference becomes a strongly developed and defended part of their self-image, and many Fours have difficulty seeing the many ways in which they are like everyone else"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Because Fours have identified themselves with their feelings, they begin to look for intensity of feeling in all of their activities. The more intensely they feel something, the more real they feel. Thus, average Fours begin to employ their imaginations to stir up their emotional life"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"To be able to renew the self constantly is the highest form of creativity, a kind of soul making, which requires a higher state of integration than making a painting or a book or a dance. This is the state the other personality types can learn from healthy Fours, and the state to which Fours constantly aspire"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Many of their problems stem from the fact that average Fours take everything personally. They must interiorize their experiences—feel their feelings—for their experiences to have meaning to them. But by interiorizing everything, average Fours become vulnerable and uncomfortably self-conscious—hypersensitive For"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"At Level 4, they pursue various outlets for their self-expression, but less spontaneously and less consistently. Since more of their energy is being used to create moods from which they believe they will be inspired, their work becomes sporadic. More of their creativity begins to occur only in the realm of their imaginations"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"For example, they may imagine themselves to be great artists, but do not spend much time actually creating art or may have doubts about the quality of what they are producing. In their imaginations, however, anything is possible, and average Fours want to surround themselves only with those people and situations that will support their self-image"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"them. However, their rage at their parents is so deep that Fours cannot allow themselves to express it. They fear their own anger, and so withhold it, trying to come to terms with it themselves. While some of the types may well feel the same degree of rage at their parents, Fours tend to have more difficulty getting on with their lives because they dwell on these old hurts"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"The Basic Desire is the central motivation for the type: it is the way that the type tries to manage its Basic Fear, and so can be seen as directly related to it. Again, the Basic Desires are universal and represent things that everyone wants: to feel loved and valuable, to know who one is, to feel competent, to be secure and happy, to be free, to be good, and to be at peace"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Their disconnection from their parents also produces a longing for the good parent—the person who will see them as they truly are and validate the self they are trying to construct. Fours usually experience this as a longing for an ideal mate or partner. They will often project this role onto new acquaintances, idealizing them and fantasizing about the wonderful life they will have together"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"By overcoming the temptation to withdraw from life to search for themselves, they will not only save themselves from their own destructiveness, they will be able to bring something beautiful and good into existence. If they learn to live this way, Fours can be among the most life-enhancing of the personality types, bringing good out of evil, hope from hopelessness, meaning from absurdity, and saving what appeared to be lost"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"The one that led left toward the A-term leads into the world of ego, with all of the costs we have just described. The other arrow leads up to Level i, and a space marked Self-Actualization. This means that if a person truly wants to achieve his Basic Desire, he must confront his Basic Fear at Level i, but also let go of his Self-image, the definition of himself formed at Level 2, seeing that it is not the whole truth of who they are"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"These represent the psychological capacities and qualities which that type draws on to achieve its Basic Desire and which form the foundation of the persons ego structure. For example, type Twos Basic Fear is of being unwanted, unworthy of being loved. This leads to a compensating Basic Desire, To be loved unconditionally or one could say to be loved for ones self alone. To accomplish this desire Twos become Empathetic, as well as concerned, other-oriented, forgiving, compassionate, and so forth"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Fours must make a leap of faith that, despite their lack of a clear sense of themselves, they will discover themselves most surely by acting positively toward others. They must love others even if they do not feel that they have been loved adequately. When they love others, Fours will begin to discover who they are, and self-esteem will follow. They will also discover that because they can love, they must have learned to love from somewhere. What they have been given has perhaps been enough after all"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"To establish a self-image, a basic identity that they can rely on, Fours turn not to other people, but to their inner feelings and emotional responses. This provides healthy Fours with intuitive gifts and a rich inner life but also introduces a problem. Of all aspects of the human psyche, feelings are perhaps the most changeable and volatile. By trying to create a consistent identity from the world of feelings, Fours, like all other types, have embarked on a path that cannot provide what they are looking for"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"Self-knowledge became their most important goal, the means by which they hoped to find some self-esteem. Fours felt that if they could discover who they are, they would not feel so different from others in the deep, essential way that they do. However, instead of creating themselves through introspection, Fours ironically become trapped in self-consciousness. Their self-consciousness alienates them, making them feel vulnerable, and arouses their aggressions at themselves and others, particularly their parents"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"In the creative moment, healthy Fours harness their emotions without getting lost in them, not only producing something beautiful but discovering who they are. In the moment of inspiration they are, paradoxically, both most themselves and most liberated from themselves. This is why all forms of creativity are so valued by Fours, and why, in its inspired state, creativity is so hard to sustain. Fours can be inspired only if they have first transcended themselves, something which is extremely threatening to their self-image"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"At Level 2, however, unlike all of the other Levels, the B-term has a different significance. The B-term column at Level 2 represents the persons self-image; thus, the terms here could be called I am terms because they represent the way that the type sees itself. To continue with the example of type Two, at Level 2 under the B-term column we find the words Loving, caring, selfless, thoughtful, warm-hearted, and passionate. These are the I am terms for type Two. People of this type would have little difficulty saying, I am loving, caring, selfless, and so forth"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"To make up for their lack of achievement, Fours at this stage typically give themselves over to sensuality as a way of deadening the too-sensitive self to its growing unhappiness. They may become sexually licentious, engaging in anonymous sexual activities for release, for fleeting human contact, and for excitement. Or they may lose themselves in sexual fantasies, sinking into erotic daydreams rather than making any real efforts at anything. They may masturbate frequently, virtually a symbol for their self-referential, ingrown way of life. They may become obsessed with those with whom they have fallen in love in their imaginations, providing themselves with an endless source of pain and pleasure, desire and frustration, violent and wasteful feelings"
10/5/20,Personality Types: Using the Enneagram for Self-Discovery,"They become aware of being aware of themselves—their consciousness is filled with little more than fantasies and memories, ultimately leading to illusions, regrets, and a wasted life. As Fours become more fearful that they cannot find a solid identity in themselves, they begin to create one out of whatever random tendencies they find. Thus, matters of taste, likes and dislikes, and emotional reactions become the materials which Fours use to construct an identity. Because their sense of self is so tenuous, however, Fours begin to put a great deal of weight on what would be for others relatively unimportant traits. (I only wear black. I listen to classical music, never country and western.) It is important to note that most of these personal traits function by negation. Fours may not know who they are, but they certainly believe they know who they are not. While these idiosyncrasies can be fairly harmless in and of themselves, as Fours increasingly depend on them to figure out who they are, they begin to paint themselves into a corner. In the interest of maintaining a narrowly defined self-image, Fours may refuse to engage in many basic activities necessary to live their lives. (Im a poet. I cant work in an office.)"

If one moves through the different states of enlargement, one can discover hitherto unimaginable and fairly chaotic landscapes in every material. At one point, however, there is a limit, at just about three-millionfold enlargement. There, the curious landscapes have disappeared and all we see is a strict geometry, a kind of net that is very clear and very specific. The astonishing fact is that this geometry looks very similar even with completely different substances or objects. Is something similar true for a human being?"

4/25/20,Politics of Affect,"In my own work I use the concept of affect as a way of talking about that margin of manoeuvrability, the where we might be able to go and what we might be able to do in every present situation. I guess affect is the word I use for hope"

4/25/20,Politics of Affect,"From my own point of view, the way that a concept like hope can be made useful is when it is not connected to an expected success – when it starts to be something different from optimism – because when you start trying to think ahead into the future from the present point, rationally there really isn't much room for hope"
4/25/20,Politics of Affect,"If hope is the opposite of pessimism, then there's precious little to be had. On the other hand, if hope is separated from concepts of optimism and pessimism, from a wishful projection of success or even some kind of a rational calculation of outcomes, then I think it starts to be interesting – because it places it in the present. Mary Zournazi: Yes – the"
4/25/20,Politics of Affect,"In affect, we are never alone. That's because affects in Spinoza's definition are basically ways of connecting, to others and to other situations. They are our angle of participation in processes larger than ourselves. With intensified affect comes a stronger sense of embeddedness in a larger field of life – a heightened sense of belonging, with other people and to other places"
4/25/20,Politics of Affect,"To get from affect to intensity you have to understand affect as something other than simply a personal feeling. By affect I don't mean emotion in the everyday sense. The way I use it comes primarily from Spinoza. He talks of the body in terms of its capacity for affecting or being affected. These are not two different capacities – they always go together. When you affect something, you are at the same time opening yourself up to being affected in turn, and in a slightly different way than you might have been the moment before. You have made a transition, however slight. You have stepped over a threshold"
4/25/20,Politics of Affect,"We always have a vague sense that they're there. That vague sense of potential, we call it our freedom, and defend it fiercely. But no matter how certainly we know that the potential is there, it always seems just out of reach, or maybe around the next bend. Because it isn't actually there – only virtually. But maybe if we can take little, practical, experimental, strategic measures to expand our emotional register, or limber up our thinking, we can access more of our potential at each step, have more of it actually available. Having more potentials available intensifies our life. We're not enslaved by our situations"

The Enemy allows this disappointment to occur on the threshold of every human endeavour.

As an acolyte in my local church, I assisted in serving communion and was told that God was there. As a university student, I majored in religion and studied various manifestations of the gods. As a graduate student in anthropology, I discovered surprisingly similar gods in very dissimilar cultures. As a physician and psychiatrist, I have studied the brain and wondered where in it the gods might reside. Seventeenth-century British physician Thomas Willis, the first person to systematically study the brain, was correct in saying that such studies unlock the secret places of mans mind"

To achieve this a new philosophy will be needed"
2/22/20,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),"It is noteworthy that modern Platonists, with few exceptions, are ignorant of mathematics, in spite of the immense importance that Plato attached to arithmetic and geometry, and the immense influence that they had on his philosophy.

2/22/20,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),"Unlike religion, it is ethically neutral: it assures men that they can perform wonders, but does not tell them what wonders to perform. In this way it is incomplete. In practice, the purposes to which scientific skill will be devoted depend largely on chance. The men at the head of the vast organizations which it necessitates can, within limits, turn it this way or that as they please. The power impulse thus has a scope which it never had before"
2/22/20,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),"There is, however, a more general argument against reverence, whether for the Greeks or for anyone else. In studying a philosopher, the right attitude is neither reverence nor contempt, but first a kind of hypothetical sympathy, until it is possible to know what it feels like to believe in his theories, and only then a revival of the critical attitude, which should resemble, as far as possible, the state of mind of a person abandoning opinions which he has hitherto held"
2/22/20,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),"But in connection with mathematics the one-sidedness of the Greek genius appears: it reasoned deductively from what appeared self-evident, not inductively from what had been observed. Its amazing successes in the employment of this method misled not only the ancient world, but the greater part of the modern world also. It has only been very slowly that scientific method, which seeks to reach principles inductively from observations of particular facts, has replaced the Hellenic belief in deduction from luminous axioms derived from the mind of the philosopher"
2/22/20,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),"During the period of ecclesiastical domination, from the fifth century to the fifteenth, there was a certain conflict between what was theoretically believed and, what was actually felt. Theoretically, the world was a vale of tears, a preparation, amid tribulation, for the world to come. But in practice the writers of books, being almost all clerics, could not help feeling exhilarated by the power of the Church; they found opportunity for abundant activity of a sort that they believed to be useful. They had therefore the mentality of a governing class, not of men who feel themselves exiles in an alien world. This is part of the curious dualism that runs through the Middle Ages, owing to the fact that the Church, though based on other-worldly beliefs, was the most important institution in the every-day world"
2/22/20,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),"By self-interest Man has become gregarious, but in instinct he has remained to a great extent solitary; hence the need of religion and morality to reinforce self-interest. But the habit of forgoing present satisfactions for the sake of future advantages is irksome, and when passions are roused the prudent restraints of social behaviour become difficult to endure. Those who, at such times, throw them off, acquire a new energy and sense of power from the cessation of inner conflict, and, though they may come to disaster in the end, enjoy meanwhile a sense of godlike exaltation which, though known to the great mystics, can never be experienced by a merely pedestrian virtue. The solitary part of their nature reasserts itself, but if the intellect survives the reassertion must clothe itself in myth. The mystic becomes one with God, and in the contemplation of the Infinite feels himself absolved from duty to his neighbour"
2/22/20,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),"I think perhaps the strongest argument on Hume's side is to be derived from the character of causal laws in physics. It appears that simple rules of the form A causes B are never to be admitted in science, except as crude suggestions in early stages. The causal laws by which such simple rules are replaced in well-developed sciences are so complex that no one can suppose them given in perception; they are all, obviously, elaborate inferences from the observed course of nature. I am leaving out of account modern quantum theory, which reinforces the above conclusion. So far as the physical sciences are concerned, Hume is wholly in the right; such propositions as A causes B are never to be accepted, and our inclination to accept them is to be explained by the laws of habit and association. These laws themselves, in their accurate form, will be elaborate statements as to nervous tissue—primarily its physiology, then its chemistry, and ultimately its physics"
2/22/20,History of Western Philosophy (Routledge Classics),"A difficulty arises from Hume's contention that there is no such thing as an impression of a causal relation. We can perceive, by mere observation of A and B, that A is above B, or to the right of B, but not that A causes B. In the past, the relation of causation had been more or less assimilated to that of ground and consequent in logic, but this, Hume rightly perceived, was a mistake. In the Cartesian philosophy, as in that of the Scholastics, the connection of cause and effect was supposed to be necessary, as logical connections are necessary. The first really serious challenge to this view came from Hume, with whom the modern philosophy of causation begins. He, in common with almost all philosophers down to and including Bergson, supposes the law to state that there are propositions of the form A causes B, where A and B are classes of events; the fact that such laws do not occur in any well-developed science appears to be unknown to philosophers. But much of what they have said can be translated so as to be applicable to causal laws such as do occur; we may, therefore, ignore this point for the present. Hume begins by observing that the power by which one subject produces another is not discoverable from the ideas of the two objects, and that we can therefore only know cause and effect from experience, not from reasoning or reflection. The statement what begins must have a cause, he says, is not one that has intuitive certainty, like the statements of logic. As he puts it: There is no object, which implies the existence of any other if we consider these objects in themselves, and never look beyond the ideas which we form of them. Hume argues from this that it must be experience that gives knowledge of cause and effect, but that it cannot be merely the experience of the two events A and B which are in a causal relation to each other. It must be experience, because the connection is not logical; and it cannot be merely the experience of the particular events A and B, since we can discover nothing in A by itself which should lead to produce B. The experience required, he says, is that of the constant conjunction of events of the kind A with events of the kind B. He points out that when, in experience, two objects are constantly conjoined, we do in fact infer one from the other. (When he says infer, he means that perceiving the one makes us expect the other; he does not mean a formal or explicit inference.) Perhaps, the necessary connection depends on the inference, not vice versa. That is to say, the sight of A causes the expectation of B, and so leads us to believe that there is a necessary connection between A and B. The inference is not determined by reason, since that would require us to assume the uniformity of nature, which itself is not necessary, but only inferred from experience"

They curse it, but its there. They dont want it, but it constantly winks at them, like a beast filled with venom. It bites into them and paralyzes their spiritual walk, just as it did with David.

Tortured by the whisperings of others, we feel like a wounded, bleeding mouse in the paws of a hungry cat. The thought of what people are saying is more than we can bear. Gossip (even its name hisses), gives the final shove as we strive for survival at the ragged edge of despair. Discouraged people dont need critics. They hurt enough already. They dont need more guilt or piled-on distress. They need encouragement. In a word, they need a refuge. A place to hide and heal. A willing, caring, available someone. A confidant. A comrade at arms. You cant find one? Why not share Davids shelter? The One he called my Strength . . . my Mighty Rock . . . my Fortress . . . my Stronghold . . . my High Tower"

Perhaps future success would help. Or (and I thought this was quite clever) I could embellish one of the justifications that had crossed my mind earlier in the day. I could do well but never be wholeheartedly devoted to any particular task"
8/27/19,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man","We want to hide, but we also want to spy. Spying might reveal the vulnerability of others so that we can believe that they are no different from us (or even not as good as us). Disgrace wants company. On the other hand, it might reveal someone who is strong and can be our hero. With a hero, we might feel less isolated because we can enter into a safe fantasy relationship"
8/27/19,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man","How could he have denied the Lord? He had seen the miracles. He was given the Spirit who revealed to him that Jesus was the Christ. He was the rock. He witnessed the transfiguration! He loved Jesus. Denial was unthinkable. But he too was like us — a fellow sinner, spiritually inept apart from the constant work of the Holy Spirit. He too could exalt people so that they seemed bigger than Jesus himself"
8/27/19,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man","However, if making a decision for Jesus means that we might spend years being unpopular, ignored, poor, or criticized, then there are masses of Christians who temporarily put their faith on the shelf. Death is not imminent, so why hurry into such a rash decision? There will be time later to get things straight with God. In other words, kill me, but dont keep me from being liked, appreciated, or respected"
8/27/19,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man",Arent the most popular mission trips the ones that take us far from our own neighborhood? Russia is easy; our own neighborhood is a constant challenge. Has anyone consistently had the boldness and clarity of Jesus in testifying about the gospel? Never. Has anyone consistently avoided the fear of man in evangelism? Certainly not. There is a foolishness inherent in the message of the cross. The clear proclamation of the gospel does not make us look good. It doesnt make us popular
8/27/19,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man","Thats the paradox of self-esteem: Low self-esteem usually means that I think too highly of myself. Im too self-involved, I feel I deserve better than what I have. The reason I feel bad about myself is that I aspire to something more. I want just a few minutes of greatness. I am a peasant who wants to be king. When you are in the grips of low self-esteem, its painful, and it certainly doesnt feel like pride. But I believe that this is the dark, quieter side of pride — thwarted pride"
8/27/19,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man","We concentrate on actions and overlook attitudes. By doing this, our sinful nature can give us a sense that we are okay. We have not killed today. We have not been adulterous. We have not stolen anything from the store. Therefore, we had a good day. Better yet, we are good. Of course, we occasionally do bad things. We might yell too loudly, or we might pick up some pornography at the airport. In these cases we should ask Gods forgiveness. But, on the whole, we tend to be fairly good. And if we think we are usually good, then God is usually irrelevant"
8/27/19,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man","Marriage has been a privilege and blessing to me. It has also been the context for a surprising discovery. I found that being okay in Christ was not quite enough for me. When I was first married, I knew that Jesus loved me, but I also wanted my new wife to be absolutely, forever smitten with me. I needed love from her. I could finally handle small amounts of rejection from other people, but I felt paralyzed if I didnt have the love I needed from her. I needed unconditional love. If she didnt think I was a great husband, I would be crushed (and, as you might guess, a little angry)"
8/27/19,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man","Significant cultural changes started in the late 1700s and early 1800s. Before this, people believed that there was a preordained, divine structure to the world. Everybody and everything had its place. If you were born into a certain class, family, or trade, your life was mapped out for you. I am an Englishman, I am a member of St. Annes parish, I am a farmer, and I am the second son of Charles. Such was your identity. There was no need for vocational and religious decisions; they had already been made for you. There were few identity crises when everyone knew who and what they were supposed to be"
8/27/19,"When People Are Big and God Is Small: Overcoming Peer Pressure, Codependency, and the Fear of Man","Sometimes I would think, Is it really Christ that I am standing on, or am I standing on my perceived successes and the favorable opinions of others? After all, other people were usually very affirming. Maybe I felt good about myself because they felt good about me. Or maybe I felt good about myself because I had done respectably in athletics and had decent grades, compared to other people. Maybe I had taken pride in my ministry aspirations, compared to other people and their seemingly lower spiritual goals. Maybe I found an identity in being nice, or at least nicer than most of the people I knew. But arent all people-pleasers nice? In short, perhaps I was still being ruled by the opinions of others, but since I was feeling fine, I wasnt very motivated to investigate"

8/12/19,Kafka on the Shore (Vintage International),"Adults constantly raise the bar on smart children, precisely because theyre able to handle it. The children get overwhelmed by the tasks in front of them and gradually lose the sort of openness and sense of accomplishment they innately have. When theyre treated like that, children start to crawl inside a shell and keep everything inside. It takes a lot of time and effort to get them to open up again"
8/12/19,Kafka on the Shore (Vintage International),"What Chekhov was getting at is this: necessity is an independent concept. It has a different structure from logic, morals, or meaning. Its function lies entirely in the role it plays. What doesnt play a role shouldnt exist. What necessity requires does need to exist. Thats what you call dramaturgy. Logic, morals, or meaning dont have anything to do with it. Its all a question of relationality. Chekhov understood dramaturgy very well"

8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Are you looking forward to the journey? Goldmund blinked. Well, I was looking forward to it; thats quite true.

8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"There might be tremendous differences of character between the learned, thin-lipped Abbot John and the kindly simple Abbot Daniel, but each of them served the same unity, the same thought, the same order of existence, received his dignity from it, sacrificed his person to it"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Any work of art that was truly sublime, not just a good jugglers trick; that was filled with the eternal secret, like the masters madonna; every obviously genuine work of art had this dangerous, smiling double face, was male-female, a merging of instinct and pure spirituality"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"In art, in being an artist, Goldmund saw the possibility of reconciling his deepest contradictions, or at least of expressing newly and magnificently the split in his nature. But art was not just a gift. It could not be had for nothing; it cost a great deal; it demanded sacrifices"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"It was a feeling that if I gave in to the enticement, if I merely reached out to touch the girl, Id never be able to turn back, that sin would swallow me like the maw of hell and not give me up ever. That it would be the end of every beautiful dream, of all virtue, of all love of God and good"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Listen: the thinker tries to determine and to represent the nature of the world through logic. He knows that reason and its tool, logic, are incomplete—the way an intelligent artist knows full well that his brushes or chisels will never be able to express perfectly the radiant nature of an angel or a saint"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"I wont let you. It is forbidden me. Perhaps you cant understand that, you little gypsy. I am doing wrong, Im a bad girl, Im bringing shame upon the whole house. But somewhere inside my soul I still have pride, and nobody may enter there. You must let me keep that, or else I can never again come to your room"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Unlike other figures, her mystery does not consist of this or that detail, of a particular voluptuousness or sparseness, coarseness or delicacy, power or gracefulness. It consists of a fusion of the greatest contrasts of the world, those that cannot otherwise be combined, that have made peace only in this figure"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"One thing made him particularly pensive. He had caught Lenes look while he bashed the man to death and tossed him down. A strange look. He knew that he would never forget it: pride and triumph had radiated from her wide, horrified, delighted eyes, a deep passionate desire to participate in the revenge and to kill"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Most people feel that way, but only a few feel it with such sharpness and violence as you do; few feel the need to become aware of these feelings. But tell me: besides this desperate coming and going between lust and horror, besides this seesaw between lust for life and sadness of death—have you tried no other road"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"She had not shown herself, and neither did Julie. His whole life had been like that, it seemed to him. Saying farewell, escaping, being forgotten; finding himself alone again, with empty hands and a frozen heart. He felt like that throughout the day, sitting gloomily in the saddle, not speaking at all. Narcissus let him be"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"In his friends narrow face he saw flower something that had not flowered there since his boyhood years: a smile, an almost timid smile on that face of mind and will, a smile of love and surrender, a shimmer, as though all its loneliness and pride had been pierced for a second and nothing shone from it but a heart full of joy"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"A man on the day of his wedding or on the day he is knighted, a woman after the birth of her first child might feel such emotions in the heart: a deep reverence, a great earnestness, and at the same time a secret fear of the moment when this high, unique experience would be over, classified, swallowed by the routine of the days"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"A dainty crown for a madonna, fashioned like lacework and beautifully gold-leafed, was no task for him, no matter how well paid. Why did Master Niklaus accept all these orders? Why did he have two assistants? Why did he listen for hours to those senators and prelates who ordered a pulpit or a portal from him with their measuring sticks in their hands?"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Had man really been created to live a regulated life, with hours and duties indicated by prayer bells? Had man really been created to study Aristotle and Saint Thomas, to know Greek, to extinguish his senses, to flee the world? Had God not created him with senses and instincts, with blood-colored darknesses, with the capacity for sin, lust, and despair"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Perhaps it was after all worthwhile to place ones entire life at the service of art, at the expense of freedom and broad experience, if only in order to be able once to make something this beautiful, something that had not only been experienced and envisioned and received in love, but also executed to the last detail with absolute mastery? It was an important question"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Id gladly chat with you about this some evening over a mug of wine. But look: to speak pleasantly and intelligently with each other is not the same as living and working together for a couple of years. This is a workshop. Work is carved here, not conversation. What a man may have thought up and know how to express does not count here; here only what he can make with his hands counts"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Yes, and was it not perhaps more childlike and human to lead a Goldmund-life, more courageous, more noble perhaps in the end to abandon oneself to the cruel stream of reality, to chaos, to commit sins and accept their bitter consequences rather than live a clean life with washed hands outside the world, laying out a lonely harmonious thought-garden, strolling sinlessly among ones sheltered flower beds"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"At any rate, Goldmund had shown him that a man destined for high things can dip into the lowest depths of the bloody, drunken chaos of life, and soil himself with much dust and blood, without becoming small and common, without killing the divine spark within himself, that he can err through the thickest darkness without extinguishing the divine light and the creative force inside the shrine of his soul"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"He had blossomed, lust hung in the air, his eyes shone, ecstasy sang in his voice, love pleaded. The three women felt it, each in her own fashion: little Julie with violent resistance and rejection, the knights wife with radiant satisfaction, and Lydia with a painful commotion in her heart, a mixture of deep longing, soft resistance, and the most violent jealousy, which made her face look narrow and her eyes burn"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Suddenly he thought he saw a trait of soul-less habit in her dear coarse face, something mechanical and unmysterious in her friendly smile, something unworthy of him. His gesture froze in mid-air; the smile froze on his face. Was he still in love with her, did he really still desire her? No, he had been there too often. All too often he had seen this selfsame smile and smiled back without a prompting from his heart"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Oh no, since he had seen those miraculous still-life images, radiant with inner harmony, come into being under Goldmunds stained hands, those intent faces glowing with spirit, those innocent plants and flowers, those imploring or blessed hands, all those audacious, gentle, proud, or sacred gestures, since then he knew very well that an abundance of light and the gifts of God dwelt in the fickle heart of this artist and seducer"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"How could these things be so beautiful, this golden glow underneath the water, these shadows and insinuations, all these unreal, fairylike apparitions—so inexpressibly beautiful and delightful, when they were the exact opposite of the beauty an artist might create? The beauty of those undistinguishable objects was without form and consisted of nothing but mystery. This was the very opposite of the form and absolute precision of works of art"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"And I was also fortunate enough in my experiences to learn that sensuality can be given a soul. Of it art is born. But now both flames have died out in me. I no longer have the animal happiness of ecstasy, and I wouldnt want it now even if women were still running after me. And to create works of art is no longer my wish either. Ive made enough statues; the number does not matter. Therefore it is time for me to die. I am ready, and Im curious about it"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"It was the overcoming of the transitory. I saw that something remained of the fools play, the death dance of human life, something lasting: works of art. They too will probably perish some day; theyll burn or crumble or be destroyed. Still, they outlast many human lives; they form a silent empire of images and relics beyond the fleeting moment. To work at that seems good and comforting to me, because it almost succeeds in making the transitory eternal"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"they aroused the desire for the highest and did not fulfill it. They lacked the most essential thing—mystery. That was what dreams and truly great works of art had in common: mystery. Goldmund continued his thought: It is mystery I love and pursue. Several times I have seen it beginning to take shape; as an artist, I would like to capture and express it. Some day, perhaps, Ill be able to. The figure of the universal mother, the great birthgiver, for example"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"All existence seemed to be based on duality, on contrast. Either one was a man or one was a woman, either a wanderer or a sedentary burgher, either a thinking person or a feeling person—no one could breathe in at the same time as he breathed out, be a man as well as a woman, experience freedom as well as order, combine instinct and mind. One always had to pay for the one with the loss of the other, and one thing was always just as important and desirable as the other"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"But he felt everything; he saw that the girls form had long lived in Goldmunds heart. Perhaps he had seduced her, perhaps betrayed and left her. But, truer than the most faithful husband, he had taken her along in his soul, preserving her image until finally, perhaps after many years in which he had never seen her again, he had fashioned this beautiful, touching statue of a girl and captured in her face, her bearing, her hands all the tenderness, admiration, and longing of their love"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"But was not every small gesture of one of Goldmunds figures, every eye, every mouth, every branch and fold of gown worth more? Was it not more real, alive, and irreplaceable than everything a thinker could achieve? Had not this artist, whose heart was so full of conflict and misery, fashioned symbols of need and striving for innumerable people, contemporary and future, figures to which the reverence and respect, the deepest anguish and longing of countless people would turn for consolation, confirmation, and strength"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Yes, Goldmund said, the statue turned out rather well. But now listen to me, Narcissus. In order to make this a good statue, I needed my entire youth, my wandering, my love affairs, my courtship of many women. That is the source at which I have drunk. Soon the well will be empty; I feel dry in my heart. Ill finish this Mary, but then Ill take a good long vacation, I dont know for how long. Ill retrace my youth and all that was once so dear to me. Can you understand that? Well, yes. You know I was your guest, and Ive never taken any payment for my work here…"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"As Goldmund was climbing out, he felt a hand hold him back by a shoulder. He could not stop; once outside on the ground he slowly turned his head. The younger girl with the braids was leaning out of the window. Goldmund! she whispered. He stood and waited. Are you coming back? she asked. Her timid voice was no more than a breath. Goldmund shook his head. She reached out with both hands, seized his head; her small hands felt warm on his temples. She bent far down, until her dark eyes were close before his. Do come back! she whispered, and her mouth touched his in a childs kiss"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"For us disciples of Aristotle and St. Thomas, it is the highest of all concepts: perfect being. God is perfect being. Everything else that exists is only half, only a part, is becoming, is mixed, is made up of potentialities. But God is not mixed. He is one, he has no potentialities but is the total, the complete reality. Whereas we are transitory, we are becoming, we are potentials; there is no perfection for us, no complete being. But wherever we go, from potential to deed, from possibility to realization, we participate in true being, become by a degree more similar to the perfect and divine"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"Still, it was beautiful to be alive. He plucked a small purple flower in the grass, held it to his eyes and peered into the tiny, narrow chalice; veins ran through it, hair-thin tiny organs lived there; life pulsated there and desire trembled, just as in a womans womb, in a thinkers brain. Why did one know so little? Why could one not speak with this flower? But then, even human beings were hardly able to speak to each other. Even there one had to be lucky, find a special friendship, a readiness. No, it was fortunate that love did not need words; or else it would be full of misunderstanding and foolishness"
8/12/19,Narcissus and Goldmund: A Novel,"He loved water very much; all water attracted him. From this spot, one could look through the streaming, crystal-threaded water and see the dark vague bottom, see a vague golden glitter here and there, an enticing sparkle, bits of a broken plate perhaps or a worn-out sickle, or a smooth flat stone or a polished tile, or it might be a mud fish, a fat turbot or redeye turning around down there, a ray of light catching for an instant the bright fins of its scales and belly—one could never make out what precisely was there, but there were always enchantingly beautiful, enticing, brief vague glints of drowned golden treasure in the wet black ground"

From which it follows that, if society is normally organised, all crime will cease at once, since there will be nothing to protest against and all men will become righteous in one instant. Human nature is not taken into account, it is excluded, its not supposed to exist! They dont recognise that humanity, developing by a historical living process, will become at last a normal society, but they believe that a social system that has come out of some mathematical brain is going to organise all humanity at once and make it just and sinless in an instant, quicker than any living process! Thats why they instinctively dislike history, nothing but ugliness and stupidity in it, and they explain it all as stupidity! Thats why they so dislike the living process of life; they dont want a living soul! The living soul demands life, the soul wont obey the rules of mechanics, the soul is an object of suspicion, the soul is retrograde! But what they want though it smells of death and can be made of india-rubber, at least is not alive, has no will, is servile and wont revolt!"

1/13/19,A Primer for Choreographers,"Form is the shape, the sequence, the organization of the ac­tion. After the initiation of the movement theme, something must happen.

1/13/19,A Primer for Choreographers,"There is one final comment to be made about these sugges­tions for action. The dancer's first impulse is often to mimic or be the thing suggested. This is a characteristic response of children, who have a wonderful belief in their ability, as the song says, to Be a tree, be a sled, be a purple spool of thread. This method often insures a magical sincerity of action that mature artists strive to recapture. But an artist's response should be more creative. Hopefully including the conviction of the child, he should be con­cerned with man's relationship to rather than imitation of the stimulus"
1/13/19,Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance Into Jerusalem To The Resurrection,"Rudolf Bultmann raised an objection against Resurrection faith by arguing that even if Jesus had come back from the grave, we would have to say that a miraculous natural event such as the resuscitation of a dead man would not help us and would be existentially irrelevant (cf. New Testament and Mythology, p. 7)"
1/13/19,Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance Into Jerusalem To The Resurrection,"So two qualifications are important. On the one hand, Jesus has not returned to the empirical existence that is subject to the law of death, but he lives anew in fellowship with God, permanently beyond the reach of death. On the other hand, it is important that the encounters with the risen Lord are not just interior events or mystical experiences—they are real encounters with the living one who is now embodied in a new way and remains embodied. Luke emphasizes this very strongly: Jesus is not, as the disciples initially feared, a ghost or a spirit:"
1/13/19,Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance Into Jerusalem To The Resurrection,"Now it must be acknowledged that if in Jesus Resurrection we were dealing simply with the miracle of a resuscitated corpse, it would ultimately be of no concern to us. For it would be no more important than the resuscitation of a clinically dead person through the art of doctors. For the world as such and for our human existence, nothing would have changed. The miracle of a resuscitated corpse would indicate that Jesus Resurrection was equivalent to the raising of the son of the widow of Nain (Lk 7:11-17), the daughter of Jairus (Mk 5:22-24, 35-43 and parallel passages), and Lazarus (Jn 11:1-44). After a more or less short period, these individuals returned to their former lives, and then at a later point they died definitively"
1/13/19,Jesus of Nazareth: Holy Week: From the Entrance Into Jerusalem To The Resurrection,"he has flesh and bones (Lk 24:36-43). What a ghost is, what is meant by the apparition of a spirit as opposed to the apparition of the risen Lord, can best be seen in the biblical account of the medium at Endor, who at Sauls behest conjures up the spirit of Samuel from the underworld (cf. 1 Sam 28:7-19). The spirit that she calls forth is a dead man dwelling among the shadows in the underworld, who from time to time can be summoned forth, only to return to the realm of the dead. Jesus, however, does not come from the realm of the dead, which he has definitively left behind: on the contrary, he comes from the realm of pure life, from God; he comes as the one who is truly alive, who is himself the source of life. Luke underlines quite dramatically how different the risen Lord is from a mere spirit by recounting that Jesus asked the still fearful disciples for something to eat and then ate a piece of grilled fish before their eyes"

The best poets are those who happen to succede in a way that flatters our current prejudice about what constitutes good poetry. We are very exacting about the standards that they have set up, and we cannot even consider a poet who writes in some other slightly different way, whose idiom is not quite the same. We do not read him"
12/2/18,New Seeds of Contemplation,"WHAT one of you can enter into himself and find the God Who utters him? Finding God means much more than just abandoning all things that are not God, and emptying oneself of images and desires.

No natural exercise can bring you into vital contact with Him"
12/2/18,New Seeds of Contemplation,"There is actually no more dangerous solitude than that of the man who is lost in a crowd, who does not know he is alone and who does not function as a person in a community either. He does not face the risks of true solitude or its responsibilities, and at the same time the multitude has taken all other responsibilities off his shoulders. Yet he is by no means free of care; he is burdened by the diffuse, anonymous anxiety, the nameless fears, the petty itching lusts and the all pervading hostilities which fill mass society the way water fills the ocean"
12/2/18,New Seeds of Contemplation,"A clever kind of insolent servility, a peculiar combination of ambition, stubbornness and flexibility, a third ear keenly attuned to the subtlest modulations of the fashionable cliché—with all this you can pass as a saint or a genius if you conform to the right group. You will be blamed in a way that gives you great pleasure, because the blame will come from an out-group by which to be blamed is praise. You may not be enthusiastically praised, even by your own friends. But they know exactly what you are driving at. They fully accept your standards. They dig you. You are canonized. You are the embodiment of their own complacency"

They are under the power of his appetites. And through the medium of his appetites, they are under the control of those who gratify his appetites. Just because he can buy one brand of whisky rather than another, this man deludes himself that he is making a choice; but the fact is that he is a devout servant of a tyrannical ritual. He must reverently buy the bottle, take it home, unwrap it, pour it out for his friends, watch TV, feel good, talk his silly uninhibited head off, get angry, shout, fight and go to bed in disgust with himself and the world"
12/2/18,New Seeds of Contemplation,"In this meeting there is not so much a fusion of identities as a disappearance of identities. The Bible speaks of this very simply: In the breeze after noon God came to walk with Adam in paradise. It is after noon, in the declining light of created day. In the free emptiness of the breeze that blows from where it pleases and goes where no one can estimate, God and man are together, not speaking in words, or syllables or forms. And that was the meaning of creation and of Paradise. But there was more. The Word of God Himself was the firstborn of every creature. He in Whom all things consist was not only to walk with man in the breeze after noon, but would also become Man, and dwell with man as a brother"
12/2/18,New Seeds of Contemplation,"For the world and time are the dance of the Lord in emptiness. The silence of the spheres is the music of a wedding feast. The more we persist in misunderstanding the phenomena of life, the more we analyze them out into strange finalities and complex purposes of our own, the more we involve ourselves in sadness, absurdity and despair. But it does not matter much, because no despair of ours can alter the reality of things, or stain the joy of the cosmic dance which is always there. Indeed, we are in the midst of it, and it is in the midst of us, for it beats in our very blood, whether we want it to or not. Yet the fact remains that we are invited to forget ourselves on purpose, cast our awful solemnity to the winds and join in the general dance"

11/22/18,Business for the Glory of God: The Bible&#39;s Teaching on the Moral Goodness of Business,"In any society, some people are too cautious by nature to assume the risks involved in starting and running a business, but others are willing to take that risk, and it is right to give them some profit as a reward for taking those risks that benefit all the rest of us. It is the hope of such reward that motivates people to start businesses and assume such risks. If profit were not allowed in a society, then people would not take such risks, and we would have very few goods available to buy. Allowing profit, therefore, is a very good thing that brings benefits to everybody in the society"

11/13/18,The Principles of Product Development Flow: Second Generation Lean Product Development,"Most product developers do not understand the statistics of granular schedules. A granular timeline subdivides time intervals into very small buckets. When we do this, the coefficient of variation for each of these buckets becomes very high. This makes variance very high and conformance unlikely. Even worse, if we incentivize conformance, people will insert contingency reserves to prevent their tasks from missing the schedule. The more granular the schedule, the larger the schedule reserves. And these reserves aggregate into even longer timelines. The more we increase planning detail and the harder we try to incentivize performance, the worse our problem becomes"

8/29/18,The Rational Male,"When a boy is unencumbered with an adult capacity for abstract thinking (ages 3-21 progressively) he is as Alpha as he will ever be.

Is there no possibility to reverse one and the other, a hierarchy of one position over the other, power of one over the other?"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,Stéphane Mallarmé focuses on an idea of Hamlet according to which this play actually only has a single hero who lets all other figures recede to the rank of extras.

4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"The aim is no longer the wholeness of an aesthetic theatre composition of words, meaning, sound, gesture, etc., which as a holistic construct offers itself to perception.

4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"The drama is a model. The perceptible has to yield to the laws of comprehension and memory retention. The priority of drawing (logos) over colour (senses), which later becomes important in the theory of painting, is already called upon for comparison here, with the ordering structure of the fable-logos towering above all: If someone were to apply exquisitely beautiful colours at random he would gives less pleasure than if he had outlined an image in black and white"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"Thus, the genealogy of postdramatic theatre includes Peter Handkes Sprechstücke. The theatre here doubles itself, citing its own speech. Only through the detour of an internal erosion of theatrical signs, via a radically self-referential quality, does the indirect message occur, and reference to the real take place. The problematization of reality as a reality of theatrical signs becomes a metaphor for the depletion, the empty circularity of the most common figures of speech"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"It is true that the act of viewing, the reactions and latent or acute responses of the spectators, had always been an essential factor of theatrical reality. Now, however, they become an active component of the event, so that, for this reason alone, the idea of a coherent formation of a theatre work necessarily becomes obsolete: theatre that includes the actions and utterances of the visitor as a constitutive element can practically and theoretically no longer be self-contained"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"When Gertrude Stein speaks of her idea of the Landscape Play, it appears as a reaction to her basic experience that theatre always made her terribly nervous because it referred to a different time (future or past) and demanded a constant effort on the side of the viewer contemplating it. Instead of following it with nervous – we may as well translate this as dramatic – tension, one ought to contemplate what was happening on stage as one would otherwise contemplate a park or a landscape"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"If signs can no longer be read as a reference to a certain referent then the audience helplessly confronts the alternative of either thinking nothing in the face of this absence or instead reading the forms themselves, the language games and the players in their here and now presented being-as-it-is (Sosein – Heidegger). In as much as it still has all the criteria of dramatic theatre as its topic, a text like Offending the Audience in a way remains bound to it as metadrama or meta-theatre"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"While it dramatized documents, it simultaneously demonstrated a distinct tendency towards oratorio-like forms, towards rituals, as which interrogation, report and court also present themselves. This becomes strikingly apparent in Peter Weiss The Investigation, which not coincidentally arose from his reading of Dante and his plan to write a kind of Inferno himself. The horror of the Auschwitz death camps is presented in cantos, heightening the material of the statements into a recitative that appears liturgical"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"For Wirth, the disintegration of dialogue in texts by Heiner Müller, the polyphonic discourse in Peter Handkes Kaspar and the direct audience address (Offending the Audience) constitute a new model of epic theatre. He conceives of the trajectory Brecht – Artaud – Theatre of the Absurd – Foreman – Wilson as an emergence of a quasi intercontinental idiom of contemporary drama, as dramatic discourse leading to a redefinition of the actor, who is used by the director as a button in the communication machine of theatre:"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"A disposition of spaces of meaning and sound-spaces develops which is open to multiple uses and which can no longer simply be ascribed to a single organizer or organon – be it an individual or a collective. Rather, it is often a matter of the authentic presence of individual performers, who appear not as mere carriers of an intention external to them – whether this derives from the text or the director. They act out their own corporeal logic within a given framework: hidden impulses, energy dynamics and mechanics of body and motorics"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"Avant-garde theatre began – before that first performance of Ubu Roi – at least with the Symbolists. Symbolist aesthetics demonstrate a turning inward, away from the bourgeois world and its standards, to a more personal, private, and extraordinary world. Symbolist performance was done in small theatres. It was detached, distant, and static, involving little physical energy. The lighting was often dim. The actors often worked behind scrims … The art was self-contained, isolated, complete in itself. We can call this the hermetic model of avant-garde performance.21"

4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"The fact that classical aesthetics – and not only that of theatre – of course had the notion of dramatic tension ought not be confused with the ideal of suspense in the age of the mass media entertainment, which, despite all technologies of simulation, is deeply N aturalistic. Here it is about nothing else but the content, there about the logic of tension and release, suspense in the sense of musical, architectonic, generally compositional tension. With respect to the new theatre, however, the conceptual complex drama/suspense leads to judgments that are nothing but prejudices"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"Compared with the epic, Hegel considers tragedy a higher language. In the form of the epic, the abstract divergence of Moira (Fate/Necessity) and impersonal singer makes the hero appear in such a way that in his strength and beauty [he] feels his life is broken and sorrowfully awaits an early death.29 The contingency of the epic plenitude of action knows no dialectical necessity yet. Hence, the voice of the epic narrator, which remains external to the hero, has to be replaced with the actual dramatic structure of fate and – in the same move – with the self-articulation of the human being (through the scenic embodiment)"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"The theatrical play in general presents something fundamentally unthinkable for the philosophy of the Spirit: the in and of itself essence-less subjective self of the player who produces signs artificially, this merely individual accidental I, experiences itself as the founder and donor of the essential, of the ethical content, as the creator of the dramatis personae, i.e. figures who already unite the beautiful and the ethical: The pretensions of universal essentiality are uncovered in the self … The self, appearing here in its significance as something actual, plays with the mask it once put on in order to act its part"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"Some of the key words that have come up in the international postmodernism discussion are: ambiguity; celebrating art as fiction; celebrating theatre as process; discontinuity; heterogeneity; non-textuality; pluralism; multiple codes; subversion; all sites; perversion; performer as theme and protagonist; deformation; text as basic material only; deconstruction; considering text to be authoritarian and archaic; performance as a third term between drama and theatre; anti-mimetic; resisting interpretation. Postmodern theatre, we hear, is without discourse but instead dominated by mediation, gestuality, rhythm, tone. Moreover: nihilistic and grotesque forms, empty space, silence"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"For this reason no organism could be beautiful if it is excessively small (since observation becomes confused as it comes close to having no perceptible duration in time) or excessively large (since the observation is then not simultaneous, and the observers find that the sense of unity and wholeness is lost from their observation, e.g. if there were an animal a thousand miles long). So just as in the case of physical objects and living organisms, they should possess a certain magnitude, and this should be such that it can readily be taken in at one view [eusynopton], so in the case of plots: they should have a certain length, and this should be such that it can readily be held in memory.21"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"The destruction of theatre time into ever more tiny pieces is thus influenced by the new fast pace. Later, postdramatic theatre will carry this demolition of the continuum into the staging of classical drama, as well. While, on the one hand, dramatic rhythm dissolves into stasis and later into durational aesthetics, on the other, theatre accelerates the rhythm to such an extent that drama falls apart, too. In many productions of the 1980s and 1990s the dismemberment of actions and time into individual numbers is very pronounced. The dialectic connection of the two time distortions – duration and acceleration – becomes apparent as soon as one focuses on the development of the peculiar time aesthetics of post-dramatic theatre.37"
4/20/18,Postdramatic Theatre,"in Hegels understanding, the experience of fate forms the kernel of the drama. This, however, is an ethical experience: something eludes the control of ethical volition, throwing a contingency into the dramatic play – and thereby into the play of the Spirit. This is fatal for the ethical concept. This contingency or plurality, appearing in the divine as much as among humans, destroys any possibility of ultimate reconciliation. What marks the dramatic is a rupture that it tries to mend scantily in order to maintain the truth of reconciliation through a stylization that empties the drama of material reality. Drama, as a beautiful art, casts everything aside which in appearance does not conform to the true concept and only through this purification brings about the ideal.30"

For a third, it dealt with particular objectified categories of feeling that had names, that could be (and were) classified and catalogued, that were the common property of humanity. It was powerless to summon up the verbally inexpressible, the ineffable, the metaphysical or infinite.

Let thy virtue be too high for the familiarity of names, and if thou must speak of it, be not ashamed to stammer about it. Thus speak and stammer: That is MY good, that do I love, thus doth it please me entirely, thus only do I desire the good. Not as the law of a God do I desire it, not as a human law or a human need do I desire it; it is not to be a guide-post for me to superearths and paradises. An earthly virtue is it which I love: little prudence is therein, and the least everyday wisdom. But that bird built its nest beside me: therefore, I love and cherish it—now sitteth it beside me on its golden eggs. Thus shouldst thou stammer, and praise thy virtue"

He has seemed capable of myriad impositions upon her but maddeningly unable to see her for what she actually is—a human being"
10/12/17,Lying with the Heavenly Woman: Understanding and Integrating the Femini,"It is the regressive capacity in him and will destroy his life more quickly than any other single element in his psychology. For a male to succumb to the mother complex is to lose the battle of life. The mother complex is his wish to regress to infancy again and to be taken care of, to crawl into bed and pull the covers over his head, to evade some responsibility that faces him"

10/12/17,Lying with the Heavenly Woman: Understanding and Integrating the Femini,No journey is too long nor heroic feat too dangerous to undertake in order to fulfill this burning need. Much of the roughness in a man is but a clumsy way of asking for this validation. And a man is so vulnerable to the threat of losing this validation. A flip comment from his lady fair is all it takes to turn triumph into ashes for him. A woman comprehends so little of this mechanism in a man and rarely knows what power she wields over him
10/12/17,Lying with the Heavenly Woman: Understanding and Integrating the Femini,"He thinks he wins his maleness by great accomplishments out there, but the real dragon battle is a totally interior one. When that battle is won, he can accomplish out there and have something to show the world and prove his value. But no amount of out there accomplishment can settle the dragon battle, and there are many men of all ages who have accomplished great things and amassed great fortunes but who are still vulnerable to the inner dragon or mother complex"
10/12/17,Lying with the Heavenly Woman: Understanding and Integrating the Femini,"In Western mythology, the mother complex is represented by the dragon that every hero has to face and conquer. Mythology, old and new, has terrible stories of the hero being attacked by a fire-breathing dragon and his narrow victory over the monster. The fair maiden awaits him only after the dragon or mother complex has been conquered. Our Western myth of the Grail and the stories around King Arthur are excellent descriptions of the adolescent elements of dragon fighting"
10/12/17,Lying with the Heavenly Woman: Understanding and Integrating the Femini,"A youth has done the hardest part of his dragon battle when he is consciously able to say, most of me wants that college degree, a small part of me thinks it is complete nonsense, a medium-sized part of me just wants to run away and not face the issue, and a small part of me wants to do whatever I am told is right. A youth is in good relationship to life if his mother complex (the part of him that wants to run away and not face the issues) occupies a minority of his energy"

Or if one follows the current trend and lets his anima rule his life without bringing discipline to her, he probably will fall into the chaos that is so common in relationship today. An ideal solution is to marry a woman who bears one of a mans anima images and invest the other in an art or creative endeavor in his outer life"

10/9/17,The Sublime (The New Critical Idiom),"As such, the sublime marks the limits of reason and expression together with a sense of what might lie beyond these limits; this may well explain its association with the transcendent, conceived by the theologian John Milbank 'as the absolutely unknowable void, upon whose brink we finite beings must dizzily hover'"

9/16/17,Goddesses in Everywoman:: Powerful Archetypes in Women&#39;s Lives,"Men for whom an Artemis is my kind of woman are often attracted to her as a twin or kindred spirit—a female counterpart of themselves.

Or they may be drawn to her as an image of purity that corresponds to an ideal in themselves"
9/16/17,Goddesses in Everywoman:: Powerful Archetypes in Women&#39;s Lives,"As long as there is an element of pursuit on her part, an Artemis woman may be interested in a man. But if he moves closer emotionally, wants to marry her, or becomes dependent on her, the excitement of the hunt is over. Moreover, she may lose interest or feel contempt for him if he shows weakness by needing her. As a result, an Artemis woman may have a series of relationships that go well only as long as the man keeps some emotional distance and is not always available. This pattern can arise if a woman identifies with the one-in-herself virgin goddess element and denies her own vulnerability and need for another. To change, she must discover that the love and trust of another special person is very precious to her"

(3) An expression of a slowly formed inner feeling, which comes to utterance only after long maturing. This I call a Composition. In this, reason, consciousness, purpose, play an overwhelming part. But of the calculation nothing appears, only the feeling. Which kind of construction, whether conscious or unconscious, really underlies my work, the patient reader will readily understand"
4/20/17,"Concerning the Spiritual in Art (Dover Fine Art, History of Art)","If, in considering an example of melodic composition, one forgets the material aspect and probes down into the artistic reason of the whole, one finds primitive geometrical forms or an arrangement of simple lines which help toward a common motion. This common motion is echoed by various sections and may be varied by a single line or form. Such isolated variations serve different purposes. For instance, they may act as a sudden check, or to use a musical term, a fermata.72 Each form which goes to make up the composition has a simple inner value, which has in its turn a melody. For this reason I call the composition melodic"

11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"The identity transcends its manifold of presentations, it goes beyond them. The identity is not merely the sum of its appearances"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"Identity belongs to what is given in experience, and the recognition of identity belongs to the intentional structure of experience"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"Consciousness is of something in the sense that it intends the identity of objects, not just the flow of appearances that are presented to it"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"The three forms are (a) the structure of parts and wholes, (b) the structure of identity in a manifold, and (c) the structure of presence and absence"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,Moments are parts that cannot subsist or be presented apart from the whole to which they belong; they cannot be detached. Moments are nonindependent parts
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"Phenomenology shows that the mind is a public thing, that it acts and manifests itself out in the open, not just inside its own confines. Everything is outside"

11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"It helps us avoid reductionism by bringing out what is proper to each kind of being, not only in its independent existence, but also in its power of presentation"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"A philosophical analysis will help us avoid the temptation to turn moments into pieces, as we might do, for example, when we attempt to separate vision from mobility"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"We can evidence the way things are; when we do so, we discover objects, but we also discover ourselves, precisely as datives of disclosure, as those to whom things appear"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"Phenomenology insists that identity and intelligibility are available in things, and that we ourselves are defined as the ones to whom such identities and intelligibilities are given"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"of presence and absence, of filled and empty intentions, that we have not yet examined. It is the fact that both the empty and the filled intending are directed toward one and the same object"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,But the mind cannot be separated out in this way; the mind is a moment to the world and the things in it; the mind is essentially correlated with its objects. The mind is essentially intentional

11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"We know instinctively that we are not trapped in our own subjectivity, we are sure that we do go beyond our brains and our internal mental states, but we do not know how to justify this conviction"

11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"How is an e-mail message different from a telephone call and a letter? Who is addressing us when we read a Web page? How are speakers, listeners, and conversation modified by the way we communicate now?"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"If the identity presents itself now in one way, it also holds in reserve other ways of being given and of reappearing as the same thing again, to ourselves and to others; it always both reveals and conceals itself"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,Wholes can be analyzed into two different kinds of parts: pieces and moments. Pieces are parts that can subsist and be presented even apart from the whole; they can be detached from their wholes. Pieces can also be called independent parts
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,Many issues that seem very complicated turn out to be simple when formulated in terms of the kinds of parts that function within them. A philosophical analysis usually consists in laying out the various moments that go to make up a given whole
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"Thus, when we want to explain how we can speak about objects that are not present, we tend to say that we are dealing with an image or a concept of the object, which is present, and through that image or concept we reach toward the absent thing"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"What often happens in philosophy is that something that is a moment is taken to be a piece, taken to be separable from its wider whole and other parts; then an artificial philosophical problem arises about how the original whole can be reconstituted"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"About a third of the way through the book, in chapter 6, Beckett interrupts his narrative to undertake a justification of the expression, Murphys mind. He says he will not try to describe this apparatus as it really was, but only what it felt and pictured itself to be"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"Marx, for example, elevates economics to the whole of social relationships, and Hobbes elevates contractual relations, which are only a part of the social whole, into being the whole. The working out of parts and wholes is central to philosophy and human understanding"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"What we try to do in our philosophical analysis is to secure the reality of such identities, to bring out the fact that they are different from their manifolds of presentation, and to show that despite their slippery status they truly are a component of what we experience"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"phenomenology, in its classical form, insists that parts are only understood against the background of appropriate wholes, that manifolds of appearance harbor identities, and that absences make no sense except as played off against the presences that can be achieved through them"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"We do argue with one another about what ought to be done and about what the facts are, but philosophically and culturally we find it difficult to ratify our naive acceptance of a common world and our ability to discover and communicate what it is. The denial of intentionality has as its correlate the denial of the minds orientation toward truth"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"There are different kinds of intending, correlated with different kinds of objects. For example, we carry out perceptual intentions when we see an ordinary material object, but we must intend pictorially when we see a photograph or a painting. We must change our intentionality; taking something as a picture is different from taking something as a simple object"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"It strives to account for concepts and thoughts as being more public than they are often taken to be. It tries to show that senses and propositions are not psychological, mental, or conceptual entities. To understand propositions and senses in the right way is a crucial matter in discussing the nature of truth, especially in the philosophical climate generated by modern philosophy"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"Another kind of reductionism, a more sophisticated kind, is the psychological; it is called psychologism. From its beginning in the early twentieth century, phenomenology attacked the psychologistic interpretation of truth, reason, and the ego; psychologism was the foil against which phenomenology originally defined itself. Nevertheless, paradoxically enough, many people mistakenly regard phenomenology itself as a form of psychologism"
11/11/16,Introduction to Phenomenology,"But once we admit that there are such things as profiles distinguished from aspects, and aspects distinguished from sides, we find that it is quite impossible to account for such structures in terms of simple impressions and ideas within the mind. If everything were simply internal to us, all we would have given to us would be profiles: flashes of color and bits of sound, out of which objects would have to be constructed. We could never distinguish among a profile and an aspect and a side"

Do you think his story would be more valuable if it had lasted another ten or twenty years?

We have the impression that if we sit close to each other well feel less alone. If were separated by five meters, thats too far. Four meters is better. Three meters is still better. But even one millimeter is still too far. When our bodies are very close, we feel it will relieve this loneliness. But if we dont share our aspirations and whats in our hearts, then even if we live together or have children together, we can still feel very alone"
10/10/16,How to Love (Mindfulness Essentials Book 3),"One of the greatest gifts we can offer people is to embody nonattachment and nonfear. This is a true teaching, more precious than money or material resources. Many of us are very afraid, and this fear distorts our lives and makes us unhappy. We cling to objects and to people like a drowning person clings to a floating log. Practicing to realize nondiscrimination, to see the interconnectedness and impermanence of all things, and to share this wisdom with others, we are giving the gift of nonfear. Everything is impermanent. This moment passes. That person walks away. Happiness is still possible"
10/10/16,How to Love (Mindfulness Essentials Book 3),"When we practice the art of mindful living, we water the positive elements in ourselves and each other. We see that the other person, like us, has both flowers and garbage inside, and we accept this. Our practice is to water the flower in our loved one, and not bring them more garbage. When we try to grow flowers, if they dont grow well, we dont blame them or argue with them. Our partner is a flower. If we take care of her well, she will grow beautifully. If we take care of her poorly, she will wither. To help a flower grow well, we must understand her nature. How much water and sunshine does she need?"
10/10/16,How to Love (Mindfulness Essentials Book 3),"We think we need someone else to lean on, to take refuge in, and to diminish our suffering. We want to be the object of another persons attention and contemplation. We want someone who will look at us and embrace our feeling of emptiness and suffering with his energy of mindfulness. Soon we become addicted to that kind of energy; we think that without that attention, we cant live. It helps us feel less empty and helps us forget the block of suffering inside. When we ourselves cant generate the energy to take care of ourselves, we think we need the energy of someone else. We focus on the need and the lack rather than generating the energy of mindfulness, concentration, and insight that can heal our suffering and help the other person as well"

The ribbon of his hat had been replaced by a piece of plaited string. Later he was having an argument with a person whom I couldnt see and then, as if suddenly afraid, he threw himself into the shadow of a corridor"

9/25/16,"Living Buddha, Living Christ 20th Anniversary Edition","If monks and nuns do not cherish their time of practice, they will have nothing to offer to the world.

9/25/16,"Living Buddha, Living Christ 20th Anniversary Edition","For any dialogue between traditions to be deep, we have to be aware of both the positive and negative aspects of our own tradition.

His life you cannot see the way. If you only satisfy yourself with praising a name, even the name of Jesus, it is not practicing the life of Jesus"
9/25/16,"Living Buddha, Living Christ 20th Anniversary Edition","In a true dialogue, both sides are willing to change. We have to appreciate that truth can be received from outside of—not only within—our own group. If we do not believe that, entering into dialogue would be a waste of time. If we think we monopolize the truth and we still organize a dialogue, it is not authentic. We have to believe that by engaging in dialogue with the other person, we have the possibility of making a change within ourselves, that we can become deeper. Dialogue is not a means for assimilation in the sense that one side expands and incorporates the other into its self"
9/25/16,"Living Buddha, Living Christ 20th Anniversary Edition","He said, Things are empty of a separate, independent self. If you look for the self of a flower, you will see that it is empty. But when Buddhists began worshiping the idea of emptiness, he said, It is worse if you get caught in the non-self of a flower than if you believe in the self of a flower. The Buddha did not present an absolute doctrine. His teaching of non-self was offered in the context of his time. It was an instrument for meditation. But many Buddhists since then have gotten caught by the idea of non-self. They confuse the means and the end, the raft and the shore, the finger pointing to the moon and the moon. There is something more important than non-self. It is the freedom from the notions of both self and non-self. For a Buddhist to be attached to any doctrine, even a Buddhist one, is to betray the Buddha"

9/24/16,In Praise of Love,"I believe this hype reflects a safety-first concept of love. It is love comprehensively insured against all risks: you will have love, but will have assessed the prospective relationship so thoroughly, will have selected your partner so carefully by searching online – by obtaining, of course, a photo, details of his or her tastes, date of birth, horoscope sign, etc. – and putting it all in the mix you can tell yourself: This is a risk-free option!"

4/29/16,Gertrude,"I suddenly realized how falsely and pitifully I had lived this whole time—that now, love, friends, customs and the joys of these years, fell from me like ill-fitting clothes, without causing me any grief. I only wondered how I had clung to them so long, or they to me"
4/29/16,Gertrude,"So this time for which I had watched and from which I had expected so much, was the only time in my life when I went my joyless way, forsaken by the spirit of music. And therein, I lived days without tone and without rhythm. Where I had sought enjoyment and inspiration, glory and beauty, I found only rules and obligations, difficulties and dangers. When any music did come, either it was something banal—done a hundred times before—or it contradicted all the rules of harmony, and so was worth nothing. I packed away all my great thoughts and hopes. I was one of the thousands who approach art with youthful audacity, and whose strength fails when it becomes serious"
4/29/16,Gertrude,"I was a patient, not exactly lazy, but not a good student, and in my last year I made very little effort. For that, neither indolence nor my love affair was to blame. Rather an indifference, an absorption in the dreams of youth, a dullness of mind and of sense, which only now and then was suddenly and sharply interrupted, when one of the wonderful, premature hours of creative desire enveloped me as with ether. Then I felt myself enclosed by a clear, crystal air, in which no dreams were possible; in which all my senses were sharpened, and on the lookout. What resulted of those hours was little—perhaps ten melodies and a few beginnings of harmonic sketches. But their atmosphere I can never forget—that clear, almost cold air, and that intense concentration of my thoughts to give to a melody the perfect rhythm and not an accidental movement and resolution. I was not pleased with these little accomplishments. I never considered them logical and good, but it was clear to me that in my life there would be nothing so much desired, nothing so important, as the return of such hours of vision and of creation"

4/27/16,The Courage to Create,What people today do out of fear of irrational elements in themselves as well as in other people is to put tools and mechanics between themselves and the unconscious world.

4/27/16,The Courage to Create,"Commitment is healthiest when it is not without doubt, but in spite of doubt.

4/27/16,The Courage to Create,"It is the seeming contradiction that we must be fully committed, but we must also be aware at the same time that we might possibly be wrong. This dialectic relationship between conviction and doubt is characteristic of the highest types of courage, and gives the lie to the simplistic definitions that identify courage with mere growth"
4/27/16,The Courage to Create,"Hence the tension that is involved in creative activity. If we are too rigid, dogmatic, or bound to previous conclusions, we will, of course, never let this new element come into our consciousness; we will never let ourselves be aware of the knowledge that exists on another level within us. But the insight often cannot be born until the conscious tension, the conscious application, is relaxed"
4/27/16,The Courage to Create,"All artists have at some time had the experience at the end of the day of feeling tired, spent, and so certain they can never express their vision that they vow to forget it and start all over again on something else the next morning. But during the night their liver grows back again. They arise full of energy and go back with renewed hope to their task, again to strive in the smithy of their soul"
4/27/16,The Courage to Create,"Then I began to notice the presence of triangles in this persons dreams. First, in her dreams referring to her infantile period, it was the triangle of father, mother, and baby. In what I took to be her adolescent phase, the triangle was composed of two women and a man, and she, as one of the women, moved in space toward the man. Then after some months of analysis, in a Lesbian phase, the triangle consisted of two women and a man with the two women standing together. In a still later period the triangles turned into rectangles: two men were in the dream with two women, assumedly her boy friend, herself, her mother, and her father. Her development then became a process of working through rectangles to form eventually a new triangle, her man, herself, and a child. These dreams occurred in the middle and later parts of the analysis. That the symbol of the triangle is fundamental"

Two 24-year-olds, who had never made a successful game, with all of their worldly possessions in the back of their car, were going to drive to Los Angeles, hire their first employees, figure out what made a great action game, work on their first 3D title ever, and create a compelling character and franchise.

3/18/16,On Moral Fiction,"Art is not philosophy but, as R. G. Collingwood said, the cutting edge of philosophy"
3/18/16,On Moral Fiction,Art is as original and important as it is precisely because it does not start out with clear knowledge of what it means to say
3/18/16,On Moral Fiction,"As a general rule, the artist who begins with a doctrine to promulgate, instead of a rabble multitude of ideas and emotions, is beaten before he starts. True art imitates natures total process: endless blind experiment (fish that climb trees, hands with nine fingers, shifts in and out of tonality) and then ruthless selectivity—the artists sober judgments, like a lions, of what can be killed, what is better left alone, such as (for the lion) rhinos and certain nasty snakes. Art, in sworn opposition to chaos, discovers by its process what it can say. That is arts morality. Its full meaning is beyond paraphrase, though critical paraphrase may make difficult things easier, even to the artist himself"
3/18/16,On Moral Fiction,"By its nature, criticism makes art sound more intellectual than it is—more calculated and systematic. Analytic intelligence is not intelligence of the kind that leads us through imitated concrete experience to profound intellectual and emotional understanding, but a cooler, more abstract kind that isolates complicated patterns and notes the subtleties or wider implications of what the artist has said. The best critical intelligence, capable of making connections the artist himself may be blind to, is a noble thing in its place; but applied to the making of art, cool intellect is likely to produce superficial work, either art which is all sensation or art which is all thought. We see this wherever we find art too obviously constructed to fit a theory, as in the music of John Cage or in the recent fiction of William Gass. The elaboration of texture for its own sake is as much an intellectual, even academic exercise as is the reduction of plot to pure argument or of fictional characters and relationships to bloodless embodiments of ideas. True art is a conduit between body and soul, between feeling unabstracted and abstraction unfelt. Philosophy is more concerned with coherence than with what William James called lifes buzzing, blooming confusion. And what philosophy does for actuality, critics do for art. Art gropes. It stalks like a hunter lost in the woods, listening to itself and to everything around it, unsure of itself, waiting to pounce"

I recall a woman who was once admitted to the clinic in a state of complete stupor. When she recovered consciousness next day, she knew who she was but did not know where she was, how or why she had come there, or even the date. Yet after I had hypnotized her, she told me why she had fallen ill, how she had got to the clinic, and who had admitted her. All these details could be verified. She was even able to tell the time at which she had been admitted, because she had seen a clock in the entrance hall. Under hypnosis, her memory was as clear as if she had been completely conscious all the time"

So when problems arise—and they always do—disentangling them is not as simple as correcting the original error. Often, finding a solution is a multi-step endeavor.

2/21/16,"Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration","My conclusion at the time was that finalizing the story before production began was still a worthy goal—we just hadnt achieved it yet. As we continued to make films, however, I came to believe that my goal was not just impractical but naïve.

Is there a way to make our managers more comfortable with unexpected results—the inevitable surprises that arise, no matter how well youve planned? How can we address the imperative many managers feel to overcontrol the process? With what we have learned so far, can we finally get the process right? Where are we still deluded?"

Thus, they focus their energies on managing upward while treating people beneath them on the organizational chart poorly. The people I have seen do this seem to be acting on animal instinct, unaware of what they are doing. This problem is not caused by hierarchy itself but by individual or cultural delusions associated with hierarchy, chiefly those that assign personal worth based on rank. By not thinking about how and why we value people, we can fall into this trap almost by default"
2/21/16,"Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration","If I start on a film and right away know the structure—where its going, the plot—I dont trust it, Pete says. I feel like the only reason were able to find some of these unique ideas, characters, and story twists is through discovery. And, by definition, discovery means you dont know the answer when you start. This could just be my Lutheran, Scandinavian upbringing, but I believe life should not be easy. Were meant to push ourselves and try new things—which will definitely make us feel uncomfortable. Living through a few big catastrophes helps. After people survived A Bugs Life and Toy Story 2, they realized the pressure led to some pretty cool ideas"
2/21/16,"Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration","The takeaway here is worth repeating: Getting the team right is the necessary precursor to getting the ideas right. It is easy to say you want talented people, and you do, but the way those people interact with one another is the real key. Even the smartest people can form an ineffective team if they are mismatched. That means it is better to focus on how a team is performing, not on the talents of the individuals within it. A good team is made up of people who complement each other. There is an important principle here that may seem obvious, yet—in my experience—is not obvious at all. Getting the right people and the right chemistry is more important than getting the right idea"

I, like many of you artists out there, constantly shift between two states. The first (and far more preferable of the two) is white-hot, in the zone seat-of-the-pants, firing on all cylinders creative mode. This is when you lay your pen down and the ideas pour out like wine from a royal chalice! This happens about 3% of the time. The other 97% of the time I am in the frustrated, struggling, office-corner-full-of-crumpled-up-paper mode. The important thing is to slog diligently through this quagmire of discouragement and despair.

Then I wont be lost in a collective whole that fits nobody because its made to fit everybody. Wherever I go, from the corner of my eye I see young people moving in groups, like schools of fish. When I was young, we all moved in separate directions. Are we developing a society like ants, in blocs and colonies? This is one of the things I fear more than anything else. I loathe collectivity.

12/11/15,The Playboy Interview: The Directors,"Then, growing up, we find ourselves in profound conflict—a conflict created by having been taught to idealize our lives, to pursue aesthetic and ethical ideals of absolute good or evil. This imposes impossible standards and unattainable aspirations that can only impede the spontaneous growth of a normal human being, and may conceivably destroy him. You must have experienced this yourself. There arrives a moment in life when you discover that what youve been told at home, in school or in church is simply not true. You discover that it binds your authentic self, your instinct, your true growth. And this opens up a schism, creates a conflict that must eventually be resolved—or succumbed to. In all forms of neurosis there is this clash between certain forms of idealization in a moral sense and a contrary aesthetic form. It all started with the Greeks when they enshrined a classical standard of physical beauty. A man who did not correspond to that type of beauty felt himself excluded, inferior, an outsider. Then came Christianity, which established an ethical beauty. This doubled mans problems by creating the dual possibility that he was neither beautiful as a Greek god nor holy as a Catholic one. Inevitably, you were guilty of either nonbeauty or unsaintliness, and probably both. So you lived in disgrace: Man did not love you, nor did God; thus you remained outside of life"
